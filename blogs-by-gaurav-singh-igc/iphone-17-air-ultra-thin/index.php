        <h4>iPhone 17 Air may ditch these 3 features for ultra-thin design, here's what to expect from Apple in September</h4>

        <p>Apple is expected to introduce its <strong>ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air</strong> this year, replacing the Plus variant in its lineup. Several leaks and reports suggest that the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> will be the lightest and thinnest <strong>Apple iPhone</strong> to date. However, to achieve this sleek form factor, Apple may remove three key features found in previous iPhone models.</p>

        <h5>What features might Apple remove from the iPhone 17 Air?</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bottom Speaker Removal:</strong> The <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> may lack a traditional bottom-firing speaker. Instead, reports suggest that Apple will integrate a single speaker into the earpiece at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>No Ultra Wide Camera:</strong> Unlike previous iPhone models with a dedicated <strong>Ultra Wide sensor</strong>, the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> is expected to feature only a <strong>48MP Fusion Camera</strong> with a 2× zoom option.</li>
            <li><strong>SIM Card Slot Removal:</strong> Apple began phasing out physical SIM card slots with the <strong>iPhone 14 series</strong> in the U.S. Reports suggest that the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> will support only <strong>eSIM</strong> worldwide, removing the physical SIM slot entirely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>iPhone 17 Air specifications and design</h5>

        <p>The <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> is rumored to feature a <strong>6.6-inch Dynamic Island display</strong>, an advanced <strong>Face ID system</strong>, and a more compact yet premium design. Unlike the <strong>Pro models</strong>, the Air variant may have slightly reduced hardware specifications but will retain a smooth and responsive user experience.</p>

        <p>With the removal of the <strong>Ultra Wide camera</strong>, Apple might utilize the extra internal space to enhance battery life, making the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> more power-efficient. The device is expected to include the latest <strong>A18 Bionic chip</strong>, ensuring top-tier performance.</p>

        <h5>iPhone 17 Air expected launch date and price in India</h5>

        <p>Apple is likely to unveil the <strong>iPhone 17 lineup</strong> in <strong>September 2025</strong>, including the <strong>iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro</strong>, and <strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>. The expected price for the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> in India is around <strong>₹90,000</strong>. With no <strong>iPhone 17 Plus</strong> in this lineup, the <strong>Air model</strong> could take its place as the mid-tier option.</p>

        <h5>Apple's push for an eSIM-only future</h5>

        <p>Apple has been gradually transitioning toward a <strong>fully eSIM-based ecosystem</strong>. The removal of the <strong>physical SIM card slot</strong> from the <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> could indicate Apple's long-term plan to shift all iPhones to an <strong>eSIM-only setup</strong>, enhancing security and streamlining design.</p>

        <h5>Final thoughts on iPhone 17 Air</h5>

        <p>The <strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong> aims to offer a <strong>lightweight, ultra-thin design</strong> while maintaining high-end performance. Although it may lack some traditional features, its sleek form factor, improved battery life, and powerful hardware could make it a compelling option for users seeking a more compact flagship iPhone.</p>
