        <h4>📜 <b>BITs Should Be Negotiated Separately from FTAs, Prioritizing National Interests: FM Sitharaman</b></h4>

        <p>🚀 <b>India's investment policies are evolving</b>, with Union Finance Minister <b>Nirmala Sitharaman</b> emphasizing that the <b>Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)</b> should be handled separately from <b>Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)</b>. Speaking at the <b>PG Certificate Course on International Commercial & Investment Treaty Arbitration</b> in <b>Delhi</b>, Sitharaman underlined the necessity of ensuring that <b>investment treaties</b> reflect national interests while strengthening the country's regulatory powers and arbitration mechanisms.</p>

        <h5>📌 <b>Key Highlights from FM Sitharaman’s Speech</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>⚖️ <b>BITs Should Be Negotiated Standalone</b>: Investment treaties should not be bundled with FTAs, as they deal with <b>sovereignty-sensitive matters</b> like <b>taxation, regulatory policies</b>, and <b>dispute resolution</b>.</li>
            <li>🔄 <b>Local Remedies Before International Arbitration</b>: A contentious issue in <b>BIT negotiations</b> is the time period given for <b>local legal remedies</b>. Some nations prefer a <b>6-month</b> timeframe, making it difficult for Indian investors to exhaust legal options before seeking <b>international arbitration</b>.</li>
            <li>🌍 <b>Shift from ISDS to SSDS</b>: Countries like <b>Australia</b> are moving away from the traditional <b>Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)</b> model and adopting <b>State-to-State Dispute Settlement (SSDS)</b> mechanisms.</li>
            <li>📊 <b>Investment Treaty Disputes Are Rising</b>: <b>UNCTAD data</b> shows that <b>70%</b> of <b>1,368 investment treaty disputes</b> are filed against <b>developing nations</b>, leading to financial burdens and exploitation by deep-pocketed corporations.</li>
            <li>💰 <b>Financial Strain on Developing Countries</b>: The <b>average claim in ISDS cases</b> stands at <b>$1.1 billion</b>, disproportionately affecting <b>emerging economies</b> in the <b>Global South</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>⚖️ <b>Why BITs Need a New Approach?</b></h5>
        <p>FM Sitharaman emphasized the <b>need to revamp India's model BIT (2016)</b> to create a more <b>investment-friendly framework</b>. She pointed out that <b>foreign investors</b> have used <b>ISDS mechanisms</b> to challenge government policies, <b>environmental laws</b>, and <b>public welfare regulations</b>, which must be curbed to protect <b>national interests</b>.</p>

        <h5>🔍 <b>BIT vs. FTA: Why Should They Be Handled Separately?</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📜 <b>BITs focus on investment protection</b>, taxation, and dispute resolution, while FTAs cover <b>trade regulations</b> and <b>market access</b>.</li>
            <li>⚖️ <b>Investor-state disputes</b> need dedicated arbitration frameworks separate from trade agreements.</li>
            <li>🌎 <b>Global trends</b> show countries <b>shifting away from ISDS</b> due to concerns over <b>corporate exploitation</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💡 <b>Revamping India’s BIT Framework: What's Next?</b></h5>
        <p>As part of the <b>Union Budget 2025-26</b>, the government aims to introduce a <b>more balanced BIT</b> model, keeping in mind <b>national interests</b> while attracting <b>foreign direct investment (FDI)</b>. India is currently negotiating BITs with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🇬🇧 <b>United Kingdom</b></li>
            <li>🇪🇺 <b>European Union</b></li>
            <li>🇨🇭 <b>European Free Trade Association (EFTA)</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📈 <b>Conclusion: A Strategic Investment Policy for India</b></h5>
        <p>India’s push to <b>separate BITs from FTAs</b> reflects its commitment to protecting <b>sovereignty</b> and ensuring a <b>fair regulatory environment</b> for <b>foreign investors</b>. By adopting a <b>revised BIT model</b>, India aims to establish <b>stronger arbitration mechanisms</b>, <b>reduce legal exploitation</b>, and foster a <b>business-friendly investment climate</b>.</p>
