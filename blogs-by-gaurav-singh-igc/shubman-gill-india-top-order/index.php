        <h4>🏏 Virat Kohli & Shubman Gill Shine as India Dominate England in Ahmedabad</h4>
        <p><strong>Ahmedabad:</strong> The walk from the dugout to the pitch at the <strong>Narendra Modi Stadium</strong> is always electrifying, especially for a crowd favorite like <strong>Virat Kohli</strong>. Even on a midweek <strong>bilateral ODI</strong>, the towering stands echo with enthusiasm, and <strong>50,000+ fans</strong> ensure the atmosphere is no less than a final.</p>

        <h5>🔥 Fiery Start: Wood Challenges India's Top Order</h5>
        <p>Kohli arrived in the second over to a thunderous reception but faced an early test from <strong>Mark Wood</strong>. Bowling at over 140kmph, Wood troubled both <strong>Rohit Sharma</strong> and Kohli, squaring up the former and striking Kohli on the arm. The duo cautiously navigated the tricky phase before <strong>Shubman Gill</strong> took charge in the ninth over, charging <strong>Saqib Mahmood</strong> for a lofted shot over mid-on.</p>

        <h6>🚀 Gill Takes Over, Rashid Targets Kohli</h6>
        <p>With Wood off the attack, Kohli settled in while <strong>Gill capitalized</strong> on the conditions. A crisp on-drive off <strong>Gus Atkinson</strong> in the 10th over set the tone for India's resurgence. As <strong>Jos Buttler</strong> rotated his bowlers, Gill exploited the dimensions of the venue, launching a six over long-on before punishing a short ball for four.</p>

        <h5>🎯 Rashid vs Kohli: A Battle of Tactics</h5>
        <p>Leg-spinner <strong>Adil Rashid</strong> introduced a fresh challenge, turning the ball sharply and forcing Kohli into a cautious approach. The Indian stalwart survived an LBW appeal but struggled to break free. Meanwhile, Gill found his rhythm, cutting Rashid for four to reach his <strong>third consecutive ODI fifty</strong>.</p>

        <h6>💯 Gill's Masterclass, Kohli Falls for 52</h6>
        <p>Gill seamlessly converted his fifty into a <strong>stunning century (112)</strong>, following up on his 87 (Nagpur) and 60 (Cuttack). Kohli, however, fell for <strong>52</strong>, nicking a delivery from Rashid behind the stumps.</p>

        <h5>📊 Gill's Consistency in ODIs</h5>
        <p>Since 2023, <strong>Shubman Gill</strong> has amassed <strong>1,900 runs</strong> in 35 innings at an average of <strong>61.29</strong>, second only to <strong>Pathum Nissanka</strong> in this period. While his <strong>Test average of 35.06</strong> in 32 matches remains underwhelming, his ODI performances have solidified his place in India's white-ball setup.</p>

        <h6>🏆 Leadership & The Road Ahead</h6>
        <p>Chief selector <strong>Ajit Agarkar</strong> highlighted Gill’s leadership qualities, reinforcing faith in him as <strong>India’s vice-captain</strong> for the Champions Trophy year. With <strong>Rohit Sharma</strong> turning 38 in April, Gill remains central to India’s future plans.</p>
