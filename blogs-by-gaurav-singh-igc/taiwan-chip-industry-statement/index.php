        <h4>💾 No Need for One Country to Control Chip Industry, Says Taiwan Official</h4>

        <p>In response to former <b>U.S. President Donald Trump’s</b> remarks on <b>Taiwan’s semiconductor dominance</b>, Wu Cheng-wen, head of <b>Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council</b>, emphasized the importance of a globally specialized supply chain. He stated that the <b>chip industry</b> is highly complex and requires a precise <b>division of labor</b>, making it unnecessary for a single country to control the entire sector.</p>

        <h5>🛠️ Trump’s Stance on U.S. Chip Manufacturing</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📢 <b>Trump’s criticism:</b> The former U.S. President recently claimed that <b>Taiwan had taken over the chip industry</b>, stressing his aim to bring semiconductor production back to the <b>United States</b>.</li>
            <li>🇺🇸 <b>U.S. chip ambitions:</b> Trump reiterated his goal of <b>restoring U.S. chip manufacturing</b> to reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor suppliers.</li>
            <li>⚖️ <b>Balanced approach needed:</b> Wu countered these remarks, explaining that global collaboration is key to maintaining a stable and advanced <b>semiconductor supply chain</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📈 Taiwan’s Semiconductor Success Story</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🛠️ <b>50 years of investment:</b> Wu emphasized that Taiwan’s success in the <b>semiconductor industry</b> is a result of decades of investment and development.</li>
            <li>🏭 <b>TSMC’s rise:</b> Taiwan played a crucial role in founding <b>TSMC</b> (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) in 1987, now the world’s largest <b>contract chipmaker</b>.</li>
            <li>🏅 <b>Global semiconductor benchmark:</b> Taiwan’s chip industry has become an internationally recognized leader due to its commitment to <b>innovation</b> and <b>technological excellence</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🌍 Global Collaboration in Semiconductor Industry</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🔬 <b>Japan’s role:</b> Specializes in producing <b>semiconductor chemicals and equipment</b>.</li>
            <li>💡 <b>U.S. expertise:</b> Leads in the <b>design and application</b> of innovative semiconductor systems.</li>
            <li>🤝 <b>Democratic supply chain:</b> Taiwan is committed to working with <b>friendly democratic nations</b> to strengthen the global semiconductor ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🚀 Final Thoughts</h5>
        <p>Wu emphasized that the <b>semiconductor industry</b> thrives on global collaboration rather than national monopolization. Taiwan stands as a <b>reliable partner</b> in the <b>democratic semiconductor supply chain</b> and remains open to assisting allied nations in enhancing their semiconductor capabilities.</p>
