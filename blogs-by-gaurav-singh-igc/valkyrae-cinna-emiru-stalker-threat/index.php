        <h4>Valkyrae, Cinna, and Emiru Threatened by Stalker During Livestream</h4>

        <p><strong>American online streamers</strong> <strong>Valkyrae</strong>, <strong>Cinna</strong>, and <strong>Emiru</strong> encountered a stalker who <strong>threatened to attack</strong> them during their live streaming event, "<strong>Sisathon</strong>," on Sunday. The incident, caught on camera, has sparked major concern among fans and the gaming community.</p>

        <h5>🔍 What Happened?</h5>

        <p>Videos circulating on <strong>social media</strong> show <strong>Valkyrae</strong>, <strong>Cinna</strong>, and <strong>Emiru</strong> exiting a <strong>Ferris wheel</strong> when an unidentified <strong>stalker</strong> approached them and asked Cinna for her <strong>phone number</strong>. She refused, joking that she "doesn’t know how to use a phone." As the trio walked away, the man <strong>persistently followed</strong> them, eventually issuing <strong>verbal threats</strong> of violence, causing them to <strong>run for safety</strong>. </p>

        <p>The <strong>streamers called security</strong> while repeatedly warning the stalker to stop <strong>harassing them</strong>. The distressing moment has now gained widespread attention across <strong>Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube</strong>.</p>

        <h5>📢 Social Media Reactions</h5>

        <p>Following the incident, <strong>fans and fellow creators</strong> have expressed concern, with many suggesting that the streamers <strong>hire bodyguards</strong> for protection during IRL (In Real Life) streams.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>One Reddit user</strong> commented: <strong>"Emiru really has some psychotic stalkers. This dude seemed mad she didn't want to give him her number… I remember when Pokimane mentioned she avoids IRL streams due to safety concerns. This is exactly why."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Another user</strong> added: <strong>"They need security. These women have a massive audience, and stalkers create delusional storylines in their heads. We've seen cases where obsessed fans broke into celebrities' homes—like the one who targeted Gavin Free and Meg Turney."</strong></li>
            <li>Some users pointed out that the same stalker had <strong>harassed the trio in previous incidents</strong>, sharing <strong>old footage</strong> as proof.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🚨 Online Safety Concerns for Female Streamers</h5>

        <p>The incident has reignited discussions about <strong>the dangers faced by female streamers</strong> and <strong>content creators</strong>. Many have called for <strong>better security measures</strong> and <strong>stronger laws</strong> to address harassment in the <strong>live-streaming and gaming community</strong>.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, <strong>xQc</strong>, a popular streamer, also reacted to the situation during his recent live session, emphasizing the need for <strong>increased security</strong> for influencers.</p>

        <h5>🔎 Ongoing Investigation</h5>

        <p>At this time, the <strong>stalker’s identity</strong> and further details remain unknown. However, concerned fans and fellow streamers are urging authorities to take action before such <strong>incidents escalate</strong>.</p>
