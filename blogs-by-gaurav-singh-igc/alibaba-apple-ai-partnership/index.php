        <h4>🤝 Alibaba Partners with Apple on AI Features, Sending Shares to a 3-Year High</h4>

        <h5>📢 A Major Win for Alibaba in China’s AI Market</h5>
        <p><strong>Alibaba</strong> has announced a partnership with <b>Apple</b> to provide AI-powered features for <b>iPhones in China</b>. This strategic move comes as Apple faces declining smartphone sales in one of its key markets.</p>

        <p>🚀 For <b>Alibaba</b>, this collaboration solidifies its position in China’s <b>highly competitive AI industry</b>, where companies like <strong>DeepSeek</strong> have made headlines for developing <b>cost-effective AI models</b> rivaling Western technologies.</p>

        <h5>📌 Key Highlights of the Partnership</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📱 <b>Alibaba’s AI to Power iPhones in China</b> – Apple will integrate Alibaba’s AI into iPhone services.</li>
            <li>🏆 <b>Alibaba Selected Over Baidu, ByteDance & Tencent</b> – Apple was reportedly in discussions with multiple Chinese AI firms before finalizing Alibaba.</li>
            <li>📜 <b>Regulatory Compliance</b> – Both companies have submitted their AI models for government approval.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>💬 Official Statement on the Partnership</h4>
        <p><strong>Alibaba Chairman Tsai</strong>, speaking at the <b>World Government Summit in Dubai</b>, confirmed:</p>
        <p>💡 "They [Apple] talked to a number of companies in China. In the end, they chose us. They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple."</p>

        <h5>📈 Alibaba Shares Hit a 3-Year High</h5>
        <p>The news triggered a surge in <b>Alibaba’s stock</b>, with its <b>Hong Kong-listed shares</b> jumping as much as <b>9.2%</b> to <b>HK$124.3</b>, the highest since <b>January 2022</b>. By the end of trading, the stock closed up <b>2.6%</b>.</p>

        <h4>🏆 Why This Deal Matters for Apple</h4>
        <p>📉 Apple has been struggling in China due to <b>declining iPhone sales</b>. The absence of <b>advanced AI features</b>, a major selling point in modern smartphones, has put Apple at a disadvantage.</p>

        <h6>📊 Apple’s Market Performance in China:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>📉 <b>11% revenue decline</b> in Greater China for Q1 FY2025, down to <b>$18.51 billion</b>.</li>
            <li>📦 <b>Annual shipments fell by 17%</b>, dropping Apple to <b>third place</b> in market share.</li>
            <li>📊 <b>Market leader: Vivo (17%)</b>, followed by <b>Huawei (16%)</b>, with Apple now at <b>15%</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💡 Analysts Weigh In</h5>
        <p><b>Lian Jye Su</b>, Chief Analyst at Omdia, remarked:</p>
        <p>📝 "This is more about recognizing <b>Alibaba’s AI capability</b> rather than just a reflection of China’s AI strength."</p>

        <p><b>Will Wong</b>, IDC Analyst, noted:</p>
        <p>💬 "Apple’s success will depend on how quickly it <b>integrates AI features</b> into its ecosystem, as local competitors are aggressively marketing their own AI advancements."</p>

        <h4>⚡ Alibaba’s Rising AI Dominance</h4>
        <p>Alibaba has emerged as an <b>AI leader</b> in China, with its stock rising over <b>40% in 2025</b>. In late January, the company unveiled <b>Qwen 2.5</b>, an upgraded AI model that it claims outperforms <b>DeepSeek-V3</b>.</p>

        <h5>📅 What’s Next?</h5>
        <p>🔜 Apple’s AI rollout in China is expected to <b>accelerate</b> in the coming months as regulatory approvals are finalized.</p>
