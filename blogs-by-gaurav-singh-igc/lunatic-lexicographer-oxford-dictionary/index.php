        <h4>📖 <b>The Lunatic Lexicographer: How a Mental Asylum Patient Shaped the Oxford English Dictionary</b></h4>

        <p>🔎 The <b>Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</b> is regarded as the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language, but few know that one of its most prolific contributors, <b>Dr. William Chester Minor</b>, was a patient at a mental asylum. Locked away at <b>Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum</b> for murder, Minor’s extraordinary intellect and obsession with words played a pivotal role in shaping one of the greatest linguistic projects in history.</p>

        <h5>📜 <b>The Origins of the Oxford English Dictionary</b></h5>
        <p>In <b>1857</b>, a group of scholars set out to create a dictionary that would document every word used in the English language since 1000 AD. Overseeing this mammoth task was <b>James Murray</b>, a self-educated linguistic genius fluent in over 30 languages. To assist in compiling quotations, Murray enlisted volunteers, and one of the most dedicated contributors was <b>Dr. William Minor</b>. Over the years, Minor submitted <b>thousands of citations</b>, providing invaluable historical references for word usage.</p>

        <h5>😱 <b>A Shocking Discovery</b></h5>
        <p>For a decade, Murray assumed that <b>Dr. Minor</b> was a distinguished medical professional assisting the dictionary’s creation from <b>Broadmoor Asylum</b>. However, in a stunning revelation, he discovered that Minor was not a doctor at Broadmoor, but a <b>criminally insane patient</b> confined there for murder.</p>

        <h5>🌍 <b>William Minor’s Early Life: From Ceylon to Yale</b></h5>
        <p>Born in <b>Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka)</b> in 1834, Minor was the son of <b>New England missionaries</b>. At 14, he moved to the United States to study at <b>Hopkins Grammar School</b> before enrolling in <b>Yale School of Medicine</b>. A brilliant but eccentric student, he contributed to the 1864 revision of <b>Webster’s Dictionary</b> under <b>Noah Porter</b>, which hinted at his future passion for lexicography.</p>

        <h5>⚔️ <b>The Civil War & The Onset of Madness</b></h5>
        <p>During the <b>American Civil War</b>, Minor served as a <b>Union Army surgeon</b> and witnessed the horrors of battle, including the <b>branding of a deserter</b>. This traumatic event is believed to have triggered his <b>paranoid schizophrenia</b>. He soon suffered from delusions, believing he was being persecuted by secret societies.</p>

        <h5>🔫 <b>The Murder That Led to His Incarceration</b></h5>
        <p>In 1872, while living in <b>Lambeth, London</b>, Minor became convinced that an intruder was tormenting him. One night, in a paranoid frenzy, he mistook <b>George Merrett</b>, an innocent brewery worker, for his imagined persecutor and <b>shot him dead</b>. Deemed <b>not guilty by reason of insanity</b>, he was committed to <b>Broadmoor Asylum</b>.</p>

        <h5>📚 <b>Lexicography as Therapy: Minor’s Work on the OED</b></h5>
        <p>Despite his mental illness, Minor found solace in <b>lexicography</b>. He amassed a vast library and, upon discovering a pamphlet seeking volunteers for the <b>Oxford English Dictionary</b>, he dedicated himself to the project.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📝 Contributed <b>thousands of quotations</b> for word definitions.</li>
            <li>📖 Provided <b>historical references</b> dating back centuries.</li>
            <li>📬 Sent <b>over 1,000 words per week</b> to James Murray.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>His work was so <b>meticulous</b> that Murray once stated, <i>“We could illustrate four centuries of English from Minor’s quotations alone.”</i></p>

        <h5>🩸 <b>A Tragic Mental Decline</b></h5>
        <p>Despite his contributions, Minor’s <b>mental health</b> worsened. In 1902, suffering from violent hallucinations, he <b>mutilated himself</b>, cutting off his own genitals in an attempt to stop imaginary assaults.</p>

        <h5>🕊️ <b>Final Years & Legacy</b></h5>
        <p>🏛 In 1910, after nearly <b>four decades</b> at Broadmoor, Minor was granted a pardon by <b>Winston Churchill</b>. Deported to the U.S., he spent his final years at <b>St. Elizabeths Hospital</b>, dying in 1920.</p>

        <p>🔎 While he was neither the sole nor most prolific contributor to the OED, <b>his legacy is unparalleled</b>. Minor’s dedication—despite battling <b>schizophrenia</b>—demonstrates the power of the human mind, even when fractured by illness.</p>

        <h5>📢 <b>Final Thoughts</b></h5>
        <p>💡 The story of <b>Dr. William Minor</b> is a compelling intersection of <b>genius, madness, and redemption</b>. His invaluable contributions to the <b>Oxford English Dictionary</b> remain a testament to his enduring intellect.</p>
