        <h4>🔆 Infinix Unveils Solar Charging Phone & Color-Changing E Ink Tech at MWC 2025</h4>
        <p><b>Infinix</b> has showcased two groundbreaking <strong>concept devices</strong> at the <b>Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025</b>: a <strong>solar-powered smartphone</strong> and a <strong>color-changing E Ink phone</strong>. While still in the prototype phase, these innovations highlight <b>Infinix’s experimental approach</b> to next-gen <strong>mobile technology</strong>.</p>

        <h4>🌞 Solar-Powered Smartphone: A Step Towards Green Energy</h4>
        <p>The new <b>Infinix concept phone</b> integrates a <strong>solar panel</strong> on the back, utilizing its proprietary <b>SolarEnergy-Reserving technology</b>. Unlike conventional <strong>silicon-based panels</strong>, this system employs <b>perovskite solar cells</b>, which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>⚡ <b>Thinner</b> and <b>lightweight</b>.</li>
            <li>💰 <b>More affordable</b> to manufacture.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <b>Easier</b> to produce.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To optimize <b>power efficiency</b> and prevent overheating, Infinix has incorporated <strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)</strong>, a system that adjusts energy flow under varying sunlight conditions. The solar panel can generate up to <b>2W of power</b>, extending battery life rather than serving as a <strong>primary charging solution</strong>.</p>

        <h5>📱 Solar-Powered Phone Case: A Removable Charging Solution</h5>
        <p>Even more intriguing than the built-in solar panel is <b>Infinix’s solar-powered phone case</b>. Unlike the phone’s embedded panel, this **removable case** allows users to switch between <b>standard and solar-powered protection</b>. The case connects via **side contacts**, delivering energy without requiring a separate **charging port**.</p>

        <h5>⚡ Why It Matters?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🌍 <b>Eco-friendly</b>: Harnesses **renewable energy** for sustainable charging.</li>
            <li>⚡ <b>Emergency-ready</b>: Useful during <strong>power outages</strong> or outdoor trips.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <b>Versatile</b>: Can be **removed or swapped** as needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🎨 Next-Gen Color-Changing E Ink Phone</h4>
        <p>Beyond solar power, Infinix is revolutionizing <b>customization</b> with its **second-generation** <strong>color-changing E Ink phone</strong>. Unlike its predecessor, which only changed colors when plugged in, the new version draws power from the phone’s **internal battery**, offering real-time color shifts.</p>

        <h5>🎭 Personalization & AI-Driven Designs</h5>
        <p>Users can now **customize the back panel’s color and patterns** with features such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🎨 <b>Preset color designs</b>.</li>
            <li>📸 <b>AI-powered customization</b> based on <strong>photos or weather conditions</strong>.</li>
            <li>🔄 <b>Real-time transformations</b> without external power.</li>
        </ul>
