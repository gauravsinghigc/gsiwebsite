        <h4>‚ùÑÔ∏è Heavy Snow to Pound Areas North of Syracuse: Lake Effect Snow in Central New York</h4>

        <p><strong>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR-TV)</strong> ‚Äî A significant lake-effect snowstorm is impacting parts of Central New York, with heavy snow expected to continue overnight and into Tuesday. Areas north of Syracuse, including Oswego and Northern Oneida counties, will see the worst of it. With snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour, these regions are bracing for a substantial accumulation of snow through Tuesday night. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the snowstorm‚Äôs impact and where the heaviest snowfall is expected.</p>

        <h5>üå®Ô∏è Lake Snow Continues Through Monday Night</h5>
        <p>The lake-effect snow band that began Monday afternoon has shifted north of Syracuse, with the heaviest snow expected to continue through Monday night. For much of the night, the snow will concentrate over the southern half of Oswego County and Northern Oneida County, with snowfall rates of up to <strong>2 inches per hour</strong> or more. Although the intensity won‚Äôt be as strong as during the day, winds will still be gusty, creating <strong>blizzard-like conditions</strong>.</p>

        <h6>üí® Wind Gusts and Visibility Concerns</h6>
        <p>Strong winds will continue to cause blowing and drifting snow throughout the night. Even gusts up to 30 mph will be enough to impair visibility and create hazardous driving conditions across Central New York. Wind chills are expected to drop to dangerous levels, with temperatures feeling like <strong>-10 to -20 degrees Fahrenheit</strong> late Monday night into Tuesday. These conditions will significantly affect travel and safety, particularly in areas impacted by the lake-effect snow band.</p>

        <h5>üìç When Will the Snow Stop?</h5>
        <p>The lake-effect snow band is expected to slide south into the Syracuse area by Tuesday night, bringing another round of heavy snowfall. The city of Syracuse is predicted to receive an additional <strong>6 inches or more</strong> of snow before the snow begins to taper off. This band of snow will continue to affect regions north of Syracuse, especially along the <strong>Oswego/Onondaga County line</strong>, where up to a foot of snow could accumulate. By Wednesday morning, the snow will gradually weaken and move out of the area, ending just south and west of Syracuse.</p>

        <h5>üìÖ Snowfall Totals: How Much Snow to Expect?</h5>
        <p>The <strong>Lake Snow Warnings</strong> currently in effect highlight the possibility of at least 6 inches of snow in many areas, including Syracuse. Some locations could see as much as <strong>1 to 3 feet</strong> of snow before the storm ends. While the snow will be heavy at times, the stronger winds will also contribute to the accumulation, especially along the <strong>lake effect snow band</strong>.</p>

        <h6>üå¨Ô∏è Blizzard Conditions and Wind Chills</h6>
        <p>In addition to heavy snow, high winds will be a major issue. While advisories for wind expired earlier, gusty winds will continue through Tuesday. Wind gusts of up to 30 mph will create <strong>blizzard-like conditions</strong>, with reduced visibility and hazardous travel. Wind chills are expected to be dangerously cold, dipping below zero for many residents of Central New York. Expect the coldest wind chills late Monday night into Tuesday, with temperatures feeling like <strong>-20¬∞F to -10¬∞F</strong> in some areas.</p>

        <h5>üõë Stay Safe During the Snowstorm</h5>
        <p>As this <strong>lake-effect snowstorm</strong> continues to impact the region, it is crucial to stay prepared and stay updated on weather reports. The strong winds and snow will make travel difficult, especially in the areas with the heaviest snow accumulation. For those needing to travel, be sure to check for any advisories or road closures and take extra precautions while driving in these challenging conditions.</p>

        <h5>‚è≥ Looking Ahead: Weather for the Rest of the Week</h5>
        <p>By mid-week, the lake-effect snow will taper off, with conditions becoming quieter as we move into the second half of the week. Currently, a system is heading toward the East Coast for Thursday, but as of Monday evening, it looks like it will remain too far east to have an impact on Central New York. Despite this, the weather remains cold, and it‚Äôs important to keep an eye on the forecast for any updates.</p>

        <h6>‚ö†Ô∏è Weather Warnings and Updates</h6>
        <p>Be sure to stay informed through local weather updates, especially if you live in areas that are being impacted by the <strong>lake-effect snow</strong>. The combination of heavy snow, high winds, and cold temperatures can make conditions hazardous for travel and outdoor activities. The National Weather Service and local stations will provide the latest updates and forecasts.</p>
