        <h4>🔥 "Shameless, Immature": Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan Slammed for Aggressive Acts vs SA</h4>
        <p><strong>Karachi:</strong> Tensions escalated as Pakistan players engaged in aggressive confrontations during their must-win <strong>ODI against South Africa</strong> in the ongoing <strong>Tri-Series 2025</strong>. Both teams were desperate for a victory after losing their first matches to New Zealand, and emotions ran high on the field.</p>

        <h5>⚡ Shaheen Afridi’s Heated Clash with Breetzke</h5>
        <p>The first flashpoint came when <strong>Shaheen Shah Afridi</strong> got into a fiery exchange with <strong>Matthew Breetzke</strong>. A seemingly harmless gesture from Breetzke after defending a delivery enraged Shaheen, leading to a <strong>mid-pitch collision</strong> between the two players.</p>

        <h6>🔥 Umpires Intervene After Heated Run-Out Celebration</h6>
        <p>Another controversial moment arose when <strong>Saud Shakeel</strong> and <strong>Kamran Ghulam</strong> got uncomfortably close to <strong>Temba Bavuma</strong> after running him out. The umpires had to step in and hold discussions with Pakistan captain <strong>Mohammad Rizwan</strong> to calm things down.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>“Shaheen Shah Afridi is so immature even after playing international cricket for almost 5 years.”</strong></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>“This kind of behavior and that too against THE TEMBA BAVUMA? What kind of shameless you guys are PCT?”</strong></p>

        </blockquote>

        <h5>🏏 Breetzke’s Record-Breaking Performance</h5>
        <p>Despite the heated moments, South Africa’s <strong>Matthew Breetzke</strong> made history by becoming the first batter to score both a <strong>century and a half-century</strong> in his first two ODIs. Following his <strong>150 against New Zealand</strong>, Breetzke delivered a stunning <strong>84-ball 83</strong>, featuring <strong>10 boundaries and a six</strong>.</p>

        <h6>🔹 South Africa’s Dominant Batting Display</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temba Bavuma:</strong> 82 runs (96 balls, 13 fours)</li>
            <li><strong>Heinrich Klaasen:</strong> 87 runs (56 balls, 3 sixes, 11 fours)</li>
            <li><strong>Kyle Verreynne:</strong> 44* runs</li>
            <li><strong>Corbin Bosch:</strong> 15* runs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>South Africa finished with a commanding <strong>352-5</strong>, setting a daunting target for Pakistan.</p>

        <h5>🎯 Pakistan's Bowling Struggles</h5>
        <p>Despite boasting a strong bowling lineup, Pakistan struggled to contain the South African batters. <strong>Shaheen Shah Afridi</strong> was the standout performer, finishing with <strong>2-66</strong>. However, the rest of the attack failed to make a significant impact.</p>

        <h6>🏆 What’s Next?</h6>
        <p>The winner of this match will face <strong>New Zealand</strong> in the <strong>Tri-Series Final</strong> on Friday. The tournament serves as a crucial warm-up for the upcoming <strong>Champions Trophy 2025</strong>, set to take place in <strong>Pakistan and the UAE</strong>.</p>
