        <h4>🚀 Sunita Williams' Homecoming: When, Where, and How Will NASA Astronaut Return to Earth?</h4>

        <p>NASA astronauts <strong>Sunita Williams</strong> and <strong>Barry ‘Butch’ Wilmore</strong> embarked on a historic mission to the <strong>International Space Station (ISS)</strong> in June last year. Originally planned as an <strong>eight-day mission</strong>, their stay was unexpectedly extended due to technical <strong>glitches in the Boeing Starliner spacecraft</strong>.</p>

        <p>After spending nearly <strong>nine months in space</strong>, the two astronauts are now preparing for their long-awaited return to Earth. Here’s everything you need to know about their upcoming homecoming.</p>

        <h4>📅 When Will Sunita Williams Return to Earth?</h4>

        <p>NASA initially scheduled the return of Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore for <strong>March or April 2025</strong>. However, new mission updates indicate that their return has been moved up, with a likely landing date of <strong>March 19 or 20, 2025</strong>.</p>

        <p>The change comes after NASA and <strong>SpaceX</strong> decided to switch capsules for upcoming missions. The planned launch of the next crew has now been <strong>moved up to March 12</strong>, prompting an earlier return for Williams and Wilmore.</p>

        <h4>📍 Where Will Sunita Williams Land?</h4>

        <p>Sunita Williams and her crew will <strong>return aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule</strong>. The spacecraft is set to land in <strong>New Mexico, USA</strong>, bringing them back to Earth safely along with two other astronauts.</p>

        <h4>🛰️ Why Was Their Return Delayed?</h4>

        <p>The astronauts were initially supposed to return in Boeing’s <strong>Starliner spacecraft</strong>. However, due to persistent <strong>technical issues and system glitches</strong>, NASA decided not to risk an early return with a faulty capsule. Instead, they opted to bring them back using the reliable <strong>SpaceX Crew Dragon</strong>.</p>

        <h4>💬 Family’s Reaction to the Extended Stay</h4>

        <p>Sunita Williams’ mother, <strong>Bonnie Pandya</strong>, recently expressed her relief over NASA’s cautious approach. She stated that she was <strong>glad NASA did not rush her daughter back</strong> in the glitchy Starliner and felt assured of her daughter’s safety.</p>

        <p>She added, <i>"She knows what she is doing, and I trust NASA’s decision."</i></p>

        <h4>🚀 Mission Update: What’s Next?</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>🔹 <strong>March 12, 2025:</strong> NASA will launch the new ISS crew using an <strong>older SpaceX capsule</strong> due to delays in developing the next-generation spacecraft.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>March 19-20, 2025:</strong> Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return to Earth aboard the <strong>SpaceX Crew Dragon</strong> along with two other astronauts.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Landing Site:</strong> The capsule is expected to land in <strong>New Mexico</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🌍 A Historic Return to Earth</h4>

        <p>Sunita Williams, an astronaut of <strong>Indian-American heritage</strong>, has already set multiple records in space travel. Her return marks another milestone in her illustrious career.</p>

        <p>As NASA continues to refine its <strong>commercial crew program</strong>, this mission highlights the evolving collaboration between NASA, SpaceX, and Boeing. With their safe return, Williams and Wilmore will bring back valuable scientific data and insights from their prolonged ISS stay.</p>

        <h4>📢 Stay Tuned for Live Updates!</h4>

        <p>📡 NASA will broadcast the landing event live, allowing space enthusiasts worldwide to witness this historic return.</p>
