        <h4>🚗 Tesla Model 3 to Cost ₹35-40 Lakh in India Even with Reduced Import Duty</h4>
        <p>With <strong>Tesla restarting its India operations</strong> and posting multiple job openings, speculation about its official entry into the Indian market has intensified. The development comes shortly after <strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</strong> met <strong>Elon Musk</strong> in the US.</p>

        <h5>📉 Tesla Model 3 Pricing in India</h5>
        <p>Reports suggest that even with a <strong>15-20% reduced import duty</strong>, the <strong>on-road price of the Tesla Model 3</strong> will be between <b>₹35 lakh and ₹40 lakh</b>. Currently, the same model is priced at <b>$35,000</b> in the US, which roughly converts to <b>₹30.4 lakh</b>. However, due to <strong>import duties, road tax, and insurance costs</strong>, the final price in India will be higher.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🚙 <b>Expected starting price:</b> ₹35 lakh</li>
            <li>🏦 <b>Import duty impact:</b> Below 20% expected</li>
            <li>🛣️ <b>On-road price:</b> ₹35-40 lakh (including taxes & insurance)</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>⚡ Will Tesla Model 3 Disrupt the Indian EV Market?</h6>
        <p>Despite the excitement, analysts predict that <strong>Tesla may not dominate the Indian EV sector</strong> due to high pricing compared to domestic brands like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🚘 <b>Mahindra XEV 9e</b></li>
            <li>🚙 <b>Hyundai Creta Electric</b></li>
            <li>🚗 <b>Maruti Suzuki e-Vitara</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Experts claim that a price difference of <b>20-50% higher</b> than local competitors may limit Tesla’s influence in India’s EV space.</p>

        <h5>🏬 Tesla Showrooms Coming to Delhi & Mumbai</h5>
        <p>Tesla is planning to <strong>open showrooms in Delhi and Mumbai</strong> in the coming months as part of its India expansion. The EV giant has <strong>officially started hiring</strong>, with job listings posted for <b>13 different positions</b> on LinkedIn as of <b>February 18</b>.</p>

        <h6>🏭 Tesla Needs ₹4,150 Crore Investment for Lower Import Duty</h6>
        <p>To make Tesla cars <strong>more affordable in India</strong>, the company must set up a local manufacturing facility. According to reports:</p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>📌 <b>Requirement</b></th>
                <th>📈 <b>Details</b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Investment Required</td>
                <td>₹4,150 crore+</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Import Duty Benefit</td>
                <td>15% on up to 8,000 units per year</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Condition</td>
                <td>Local production setup</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>🔍 Tesla’s Future in India</h4>
        <p>The key to Tesla’s success in India depends on whether it <strong>commits to large-scale investment in local manufacturing</strong>. Without it, even with lower import duties, <strong>Tesla cars may remain out of reach</strong> for most Indian buyers.</p>
