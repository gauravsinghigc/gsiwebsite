        <h4>🎭 Built like a juggernaut: Elon Musk’s 14th child, Seldon Lycurgus, has Punjabi roots</h4>

        <p>The <strong>herd of Musk kids</strong> is expanding once again! Tech mogul <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has welcomed his <strong>14th child</strong> and his <strong>4th with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis</strong>, who recently announced the news on <strong>X (formerly Twitter)</strong>.</p>

        <h4>👶 Baby boy’s arrival!</h4>

        <p><strong>Shivon Zilis</strong> took to <strong>X</strong> and wrote:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Discussed with <strong>Elon</strong> and, in light of beautiful <strong>Arcadia’s birthday</strong>, we felt it was better to also just share directly about our wonderful and incredible son, <strong>Seldon Lycurgus</strong>. Built like a juggernaut, with a solid heart of gold. Love him so much.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This announcement came while celebrating the <strong>first birthday of their third child, Arcadia</strong>. Until now, the name and gender of their third child had not been publicly disclosed.</p>

        <h4>📌 Musk and Zilis' expanding family</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>💙 <strong>Twins Strider and Azure</strong></li>
            <li>💜 <strong>Arcadia</strong></li>
            <li>💛 <strong>Seldon Lycurgus</strong> (newborn)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With Seldon’s birth, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> now has <strong>14 children</strong>, including those with other partners.</p>

        <h4>🌏 Punjabi roots of Seldon Lycurgus</h4>

        <p>The birth of <strong>Seldon Lycurgus</strong> has also drawn attention to his <strong>Punjabi heritage</strong>. <strong>Shivon Zilis</strong>, who is a <strong>Neuralink executive</strong>, was born in Ontario, Canada, to a <strong>Punjabi Indian mother</strong> and a <strong>Caucasian Canadian father</strong>. In a 2015 interview, she mentioned, “I pretty much turned out white — I just got the big eyes from the Punjabi side.”</p>

        <p>With this, four of <strong>Elon Musk’s children</strong> now share <strong>Indian roots</strong>, specifically from <strong>Punjab</strong>.</p>

        <h4>🔍 The meaning behind the name: Seldon Lycurgus</h4>

        <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> has always chosen <strong>unique baby names</strong> for his children, often inspired by <strong>science fiction</strong> and <strong>historical figures</strong>. <strong>Seldon Lycurgus</strong> follows this tradition:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📚 <strong>Seldon</strong> – Likely inspired by <strong>Hari Seldon</strong>, the mathematician and visionary from <em>Isaac Asimov's Foundation series</em>, who developed "psychohistory" to predict the future.</li>
            <li>🏛️ <strong>Lycurgus</strong> – Named after the <strong>Spartan lawgiver</strong> credited with shaping Sparta’s military-focused society.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given <strong>Elon Musk’s love for science fiction</strong> and history, the name fits perfectly into his pattern of choosing distinctive and meaningful names.</p>
