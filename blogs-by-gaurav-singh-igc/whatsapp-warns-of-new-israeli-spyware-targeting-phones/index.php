        <h4><strong>WhatsApp Accuses Paragon Solutions of Targeting Journalists with Israeli Spyware</strong></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">WhatsApp has accused Israeli spyware company <strong>Paragon Solutions</strong> of launching a sophisticated hacking campaign targeting nearly 100 journalists and civil society members. This attack involved <strong>Graphite spyware</strong>, a zero-click malware that infiltrates devices without requiring any interaction from the victim. Such attacks are especially concerning as they compromise <strong>personal data</strong> and sensitive communications without the targetâ€™s knowledge.</p>

        <h5><strong>Zero-Click Attack: A New Cyber Threat</strong></h5>

        <p class="text-justify">WhatsApp claims to have high confidence that around <strong>90 users</strong>, including <strong>journalists</strong> and <strong>activists</strong>, were specifically targeted. Although WhatsApp has not disclosed the locations of the affected individuals, the platform confirmed that they were notified about the potential breach. WhatsApp also took swift legal action by sending a <strong>cease and desist letter</strong> to Paragon Solutions and is exploring further legal options to hold the company accountable for its role in the attack.</p>

        <h5><strong>Graphite Spyware: A Dangerous Tool</strong></h5>

        <p class="text-justify">Paragon Solutions, based in Virginia, USA, is known for developing the <strong>Graphite spyware</strong>, a tool comparable to the infamous <strong>Pegasus spyware</strong> developed by NSO Group. Once installed, Graphite gives the attacker complete access to the device, enabling them to read messages sent through encrypted apps like <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Signal</strong>. This breach raises significant concerns about the security of encrypted messaging platforms.</p>

        <h5><strong>The Identity of the Attackers</strong></h5>

        <p class="text-justify">The exact identity of the attackers remains unclear. Paragon Solutions primarily sells its software to <strong>government clients</strong>, but WhatsApp has not been able to determine which government initiated the attacks. A source close to Paragon claims that the company has 35 government clients, all of which are reportedly democratic nations. However, WhatsApp noted that Paragon avoids working with countries that have a history of <strong>spyware abuse</strong>, such as <strong>Greece</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>, <strong>Hungary</strong>, <strong>Mexico</strong>, and <strong>India</strong>.</p>

        <h5><strong>The Growing Issue of Commercial Spyware</strong></h5>

        <p class="text-justify">This incident is part of a larger pattern of increasing scrutiny surrounding the commercial spyware industry. <strong>Natalia Krapiva</strong>, senior tech legal counsel at <strong>Access Now</strong>, highlighted that Paragon Solutions, previously considered a "better" spyware company, is now facing criticism after WhatsApp's revelations. She pointed out that such abuses are not isolated incidents, but rather a feature of the <strong>commercial spyware</strong> industry as a whole.</p>

        <h5><strong>WhatsApp's Legal Victory and Future Actions</strong></h5>

        <p class="text-justify">WhatsApp's announcement comes shortly after its legal victory against NSO Group, another Israeli spyware maker. In December, a California judge ruled that NSO was liable for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users in 2019, violating <strong>US hacking laws</strong> and WhatsApp's <strong>terms of service</strong>. Following this, NSO was blacklisted by the US commerce department in 2021 due to its actions deemed contrary to <strong>US national security interests</strong>.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">While WhatsApp has not disclosed how long the targeted individuals may have been under threat, it confirmed that the attacks were <strong>disrupted in December</strong>. The company is now working to support the affected users and strengthen its security measures to protect against future breaches and <strong>cyber attacks</strong>.</p>
