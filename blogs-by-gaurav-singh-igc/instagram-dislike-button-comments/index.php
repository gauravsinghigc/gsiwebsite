        <h4>👎 Instagram Confirms It Is Testing a “Dislike” Button for Comments</h4>

        <h5>📢 Instagram Introduces Private Downvotes for Comments</h5>
        <p>In recent days, some <strong>Instagram</strong> users have reported seeing a <b>new “dislike” button</b> when scrolling through the comments section of a post or Reel. Now, <strong>Instagram head Adam Mosseri</strong> has officially confirmed that the company is <b>testing a dislike button</b> for comments.</p>

        <p>The feature is currently available only to a <b>small group of users</b> as part of a limited test. However, Meta has not revealed when or if the dislike button will be rolled out to a wider audience.</p>

        <h5>🔍 How the Instagram Dislike Button Works</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>👎 The <b>dislike button</b> allows users to privately downvote comments.</li>
            <li>🔢 Unlike likes, <b>dislike counts will not be publicly visible</b>.</li>
            <li>📊 Downvotes will be used to <b>rank comments</b>, pushing negative or irrelevant comments lower.</li>
            <li>🛑 No one (including the comment poster) will be notified if their comment gets disliked.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📉 Similar to YouTube’s Dislike Button</h5>
        <p>Meta’s implementation of the <b>Instagram dislike button</b> follows a model similar to <strong>YouTube</strong>, which <b>removed public dislike counts</b> on videos back in 2021. Instagram’s goal is to <b>reduce toxic interactions</b> while still allowing users to signal disapproval.</p>

        <h5>🗣️ Official Statement from Instagram</h5>
        <p>According to <strong>Instagram spokesperson Christine Pai</strong>, the feature is currently <b>being tested with a small group of people</b>. However, there’s no timeline for a full rollout.</p>

        <h4>📲 Instagram’s Recent Updates & Parental Controls</h4>
        <p>Alongside the dislike button test, Instagram recently <b>expanded Teen Accounts to India</b>, introducing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parental controls to <b>monitor and manage children’s activities</b>.</li>
            <li>⏳ Options to <b>set daily time limits</b> and reminders to take breaks.</li>
        </ul>
