        <h4>☄️ Asteroid 2024 YR4: Should We Be Worried About Its Impact?</h4>

        <h5>🚀 Increased Impact Probability – What’s Happening?</h5>
        <p>New data reveals that the odds of asteroid <b>2024 YR4</b> impacting Earth in <b>2031</b> have increased to <b>1 in 43</b>, doubling from previous estimates. However, experts emphasize that <b>there is no immediate reason to panic</b>. The asteroid currently leads the risk list at NASA’s <b>Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)</b>, but as tracking improves, the impact probability is expected to decrease.</p>

        <h5>🔍 Key Facts About Asteroid 2024 YR4</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📅 <b>Discovered on:</b> December 27, 2024</li>
            <li>🔭 <b>Spotted by:</b> ATLAS Telescope, Chile</li>
            <li>🌍 <b>Estimated Diameter:</b> 40 to 100 meters</li>
            <li>🛰️ <b>Current Impact Odds:</b> 1 in 43 (2.3% probability)</li>
            <li>💨 <b>Closest Approach:</b> Expected in <b>2031</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📈 Why Did the Impact Odds Increase?</h5>
        <p>Asteroid tracking improves as more data is collected. Initial calculations have uncertainty, and early estimations often fluctuate before settling on more accurate predictions. According to asteroid hunter <b>David Rankin</b>, this is a normal process in planetary defense, and the likelihood of impact could decrease again.</p>

        <h5>🔬 Scientific Explanation – “Line of Variation”</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📡 When an asteroid is newly discovered, only some orbital details are clear.</li>
            <li>⚖️ We can confirm the plane it orbits but not its exact position along that plane.</li>
            <li>🛤️ This leads to an uncertainty zone called the "<b>Line of Variation</b>."</li>
            <li>📍 As of now, this zone passes through Earth, but better tracking could refine this path.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🛑 Should We Panic?</h5>
        <p><b>Not at all.</b> While the impact probability increased, experts say <b>the asteroid is still more likely to miss</b>. With improved tracking, scientists expect the odds to drop. NASA, ESA, and other space agencies are actively monitoring the situation and will provide updated risk assessments.</p>

        <h5>🌍 Advancements in Planetary Defense</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🔭 More <b>advanced asteroid detection</b> systems help identify threats earlier.</li>
            <li>🛰️ NASA’s <b>DART Mission</b> has already demonstrated asteroid deflection technology.</li>
            <li>📡 Space agencies worldwide are improving <b>tracking and impact prediction</b> models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📌 Final Verdict: Stay Informed, Not Alarmed</h5>
        <p>The increase in impact probability is part of the normal tracking process. As more observations refine calculations, the odds of asteroid <b>2024 YR4</b> hitting Earth are likely to <b>decrease</b>. Space agencies are closely monitoring its path, ensuring any real threat is detected well in advance.</p>
