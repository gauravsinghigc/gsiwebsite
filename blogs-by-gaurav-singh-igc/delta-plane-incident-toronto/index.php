        <p>At least <strong>18 people were injured</strong> after a Delta Air Lines plane, arriving from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, overturned upon landing at <strong>Toronto Pearson International Airport</strong> on Monday. The incident has left the aviation world in shock, but fortunately, no fatalities were reported. The injuries sustained were relatively minor, with emergency response teams quickly on-site to provide aid to those affected.</p>

        <h5>üìπ A Surreal Scene at Toronto Pearson: Plane Overturns After Landing</h5>
        <p>Video footage posted on social media captured the <strong>surreal scene</strong> as the Delta plane, a CRJ-900, flipped completely upside down on the runway. The footage showed emergency responders evacuating passengers and attending to the crash site. One passenger, John Nelson, who recorded the incident, described the scene as chaotic yet assuring. "We just landed. Our plane crashed. It's upside down," he said, noting that "most people appear to be OK" and passengers were disembarking the aircraft calmly.</p>

        <h6>üöë Emergency Response and Injuries</h6>
        <p>Toronto Pearson's CEO, Deborah Flint, confirmed that <strong>none of the injuries</strong> were life-threatening. Of the 18 people injured, 12 were taken by ground transportation for further medical evaluation, while two others were airlifted to nearby trauma centers.
