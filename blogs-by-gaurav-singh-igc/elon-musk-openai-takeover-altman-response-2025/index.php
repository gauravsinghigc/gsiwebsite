                        <h4>💰 Musk-Led Group Bids $97.4 Billion for Control of OpenAI</h4>

                        <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> and a consortium of investors have submitted a <strong>$97.4 billion bid</strong> to acquire <strong>all assets</strong> of the nonprofit overseeing <strong>OpenAI</strong>. The move is seen as an escalation of Musk’s ongoing rivalry with <strong>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</strong>.</p>

                        <h5>🚀 What Led to Musk’s OpenAI Buyout Offer?</h5>

                        <ul>
                            <li>🧠 OpenAI, founded in <strong>2015</strong> by <strong>Sam Altman and Elon Musk</strong>, was initially structured as a nonprofit.</li>
                            <li>🔄 In recent years, OpenAI has moved toward a <strong>for-profit model</strong>, prompting criticism from Musk.</li>
                            <li>⚖️ Musk, who left OpenAI in <strong>2019</strong> to start his own AI firm <strong>xAI</strong>, previously sued OpenAI over its restructuring.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>📢 Musk’s Justification for the Acquisition</h4>

                        <p>Attorney <strong>Marc Toberoff</strong>, representing Musk’s investor group, justified the bid by arguing that OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model <strong>undermines its original mission</strong>.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "If Sam Altman and the present OpenAI board are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away: control over the most transformative technology of our time."
                        </blockquote>

                        <h5>❌ Altman Rejects Musk’s Offer with a Sharp Response</h5>

                        <p><strong>Sam Altman</strong> publicly dismissed Musk’s bid with a sarcastic post on <strong>X</strong> (formerly Twitter):</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>This remark referenced Musk’s <strong>2022 acquisition of Twitter</strong> for <strong>$44 billion</strong> and its subsequent valuation decline.</p>
