        <h4>🚀 Elon Musk supports US withdrawal from UN and NATO</h4>

        <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has publicly supported the idea of the <strong>United States withdrawing from the United Nations (UN) and NATO</strong>. His statement has sparked widespread debate on social media and political circles.</p>

        <h5>📢 Musk's statement on US withdrawal</h5>

        <p>Musk responded to a social media post that stated, <strong>"It's time for the United States to leave NATO and the UN,"</strong> by replying with <strong>"I agree."</strong> This statement has reignited discussions about the role of the US in global organizations.</p>

        <h5>📜 US legislation on UN withdrawal</h5>

        <p>In February 2025, Senator <strong>Mike Lee</strong> introduced the <strong>Disengaging Entirely From the United Nations Debacle Act of 2025</strong>. This proposed legislation aims to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Terminate US <strong>membership in the UN</strong> and its affiliated organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Cease financial contributions</strong> to the UN and its associated entities.</li>
            <li>Revoke the agreement allowing the <strong>UN headquarters to remain in New York</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove <strong>diplomatic immunity</strong> for UN employees in the United States.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🎙️ US Senator Mike Lee’s views</h5>

        <p>Senator Mike Lee, in an interview with Fox News Digital, criticized the UN, stating:</p>

        <blockquote>"The UN has become a platform for tyrants and a venue to attack America and her allies. As President Trump prioritizes America first, we should withdraw from this sham organization and focus on real alliances that ensure national security and economic prosperity."</blockquote>

        <h5>💰 US financial contributions to the UN</h5>

        <p>The United States is the <strong>largest financial contributor to the UN</strong>. In 2022, the US provided over <strong>$18 billion</strong> in funding, covering a substantial portion of the UN's budget.</p>

        <h5>⚖️ Trump’s stance on NATO</h5>

        <p>Former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has repeatedly criticized NATO’s financial structure. He has warned that the US might pull out of the <strong>North Atlantic Alliance</strong> if European allies do not take greater financial responsibility for their own defense.</p>

        <h5>🌍 Global impact of a US withdrawal</h5>

        <p>The possibility of a US withdrawal from the <strong>UN and NATO</strong> could have significant consequences, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geopolitical shifts</strong>—increased uncertainty in global alliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial restructuring</strong>—other nations might need to increase contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Diplomatic challenges</strong>—changes in US global influence and foreign relations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📊 Future of US foreign policy</h5>

        <p>While Musk’s support adds fuel to the debate, the decision to withdraw from international organizations like the UN and NATO rests with policymakers. The proposed legislation and ongoing discussions indicate a potential <strong>reshaping of US foreign policy</strong>.</p>
