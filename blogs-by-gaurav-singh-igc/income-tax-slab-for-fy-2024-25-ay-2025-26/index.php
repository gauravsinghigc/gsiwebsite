        <!-- Surcharge and Cess Table -->
        <table class="table table-bordered">

                <tr>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Cess:</strong> An additional <strong>Health and Education Cess</strong> of <strong>4%</strong> will be levied on the total tax liability, including surcharge, for all taxpayers.</p>

        <h5>Taxation on ULIPs: New Rules</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">In Budget 2025, an important change has been made regarding the taxation of <strong>Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)</strong>. If the annual premium of a ULIP exceeds ₹2.5 lakh, it will be taxed as <strong>capital gains</strong> or <strong>income from other sources</strong>. This amendment aims to bring more clarity on the taxation of ULIPs and non-ULIPs, especially where the premium exceeds the specified threshold.</p>

        <h5>Fixed Deposit Tax Relief for Senior Citizens</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">A significant benefit for senior citizens has been introduced. The <strong>TDS threshold</strong> on interest earned from fixed deposits has been increased from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000, providing senior citizens with greater relief and avoiding the hassle of filing returns for interest income up to ₹1 lakh.</p>

        <h5>Income Tax for Salaried Employees</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">In another important announcement, the Finance Minister revealed that salaried employees earning up to ₹12 lakh annually (excluding special income like capital gains) will be tax-free under the new regime, due to an increased <strong>tax rebate</strong> and <strong>standard deduction</strong>. Employees can now avail of a <strong>standard deduction of ₹75,000</strong> from their income, further reducing their taxable income.</p>

        <h5>Tax Rebate under Section 87A</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">For taxpayers with a total income of up to ₹7 lakh, the government has increased the <strong>rebate under Section 87A</strong>, making their tax liability effectively <strong>zero</strong>. This change is aimed at providing more relief to low-income taxpayers under the new tax regime.</p>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">The Union Budget 2025 has introduced several important reforms to simplify the tax system and provide relief to the middle class. With revised income tax slabs, increased tax-free income limits, and enhanced rebates, taxpayers can expect a more favorable tax environment for the upcoming financial year. As always, taxpayers should evaluate both the <strong>old</strong> and <strong>new tax regimes</strong> to determine the most beneficial option based on their specific financial situation.</p>
