        <h4>📜 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to Introduce Income-Tax Bill 2025 in Lok Sabha</h4>
        <p><strong>New Delhi, February 13:</strong> Finance Minister <strong>Nirmala Sitharaman</strong> is set to introduce the <strong>Income-Tax Bill 2025</strong> in the <strong>Lok Sabha</strong> today. The Bill aims to <strong>modernize and streamline tax laws</strong>, replacing the <strong>six-decade-old Income Tax Act of 1964</strong>.</p>

        <h5>🔹 Objective of the New Income-Tax Bill 2025</h5>
        <p>The new Bill does not impose any additional taxes but seeks to <strong>simplify and consolidate</strong> existing tax regulations. It is expected to come into effect from <strong>April 2026</strong>, making tax laws <strong>more transparent and easier to understand</strong>.</p>

        <h6>📌 Key Highlights of the Income-Tax Bill 2025</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>📑 <strong>Elimination of obsolete sections</strong> to reduce litigation and improve tax compliance.</li>
            <li>📝 <strong>Simplified terminology</strong>: Concepts like ‘assessment year’ and ‘previous year’ will be replaced with <strong>‘tax year’</strong> to simplify tax filing.</li>
            <li>🚀 <strong>Modernized language</strong>: Removal of complex legal jargon such as ‘notwithstanding’ and replacing it with ‘irrespective’.</li>
            <li>🛑 <strong>Omission of redundant provisions</strong>, such as those related to <strong>Fringe Benefit Tax</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📅 What Changes for Taxpayers?</h5>
        <p>The shift to a <strong>‘tax year’</strong> system means income earned between <strong>April 2024 and March 2025</strong> will be assessed in the same period, removing the need for a separate assessment year.</p>
