        <h4>🚖 Uber to Charge Zero Commission from Indian Auto-Rickshaw Drivers: What It Means for Users</h4>

        <p><b>Uber India</b> has introduced a groundbreaking change—<b>auto-rickshaw drivers will now take home 100% of their earnings</b>, as Uber shifts to a <b>subscription-based model</b>. Instead of charging commissions, Uber will now collect a flat subscription fee from drivers.</p>

        <p><b>"Uber will not charge any commission on your auto trip. Whatever fare you pay goes entirely to the driver,"</b> the company announced in a <b>blog post</b> on <b>February 18, 2025</b>.</p>

        <p>This shift aligns Uber with platforms like <b>Namma Yatri</b> and <b>Rapido</b>, both of which follow a similar model. The move is expected to enhance Uber’s competitiveness while addressing driver concerns regarding <b>high commission rates</b>.</p>

        <h5>🛠️ What’s Changing for Uber Users?</h5>

        <p>With Uber eliminating commissions, the platform will now act as a <b>matchmaking service</b> between riders and auto drivers. The <b>auto-rickshaw service on Uber is now independent</b>, meaning:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Uber will not decide fares</b> – Riders and drivers will negotiate the final price.</li>
            <li><b>Uber will not charge cancellation fees</b> – Users can cancel auto rides anytime without a penalty.</li>
            <li><b>Uber will not handle payments</b> – Riders must pay the driver <b>directly via cash or UPI</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Uber remains responsible for safety</b> – Users can still report concerns through the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💰 How Does This Impact Auto-Rickshaw Fares?</h5>

        <p>Uber will no longer control fares. Instead, it will <b>suggest a price</b> based on distance and demand, but <b>final pricing is negotiable</b> between the rider and the driver.</p>

        <h6>🔹 Key Changes in Fare Structure:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Surge Pricing Removed:</b> No dynamic pricing during peak hours.</li>
            <li><b>Direct Fare Negotiation:</b> Riders and drivers will agree on the final price.</li>
            <li><b>Full Earnings for Drivers:</b> No deductions from fares.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📊 Uber vs Other Auto-Rickshaw Aggregators</h5>

        <p>With this shift, Uber’s new model places it in direct competition with <b>Rapido</b> and <b>Namma Yatri</b>, both of which operate on similar principles.</p>
