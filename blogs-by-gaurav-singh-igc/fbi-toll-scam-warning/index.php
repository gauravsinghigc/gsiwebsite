                    <h4>FBI Warns Android & iPhone Users in the US to Delete Suspicious Scam Texts</h4>

                    <p>The <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</strong> has issued an alert urging <strong>Android and iPhone users in the United States</strong> to delete any suspicious text messages related to <strong>unpaid tolls</strong>. The warning follows a recent <strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alert</strong> regarding fraudulent messages impersonating toll agencies. These scams not only demand fake payments but also pose serious risks of <strong>identity theft</strong>.</p>

                    <h5>🚨 What Is the Toll Scam Alert About?</h5>

                    <p>Scammers are sending fake text messages that falsely claim recipients have <strong>outstanding toll bills</strong>. These messages often contain malicious links that, if clicked, can steal personal data such as <strong>driver’s license numbers and payment details</strong>. The FTC has warned that such scams are being reported across multiple states, including <strong>Florida, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Washington</strong>.</p>

                    <h6>📍 Recent Scam Alert in Montana</h6>

                    <p>On <strong>February 7</strong>, authorities in <strong>Great Falls, Montana</strong> issued a scam alert to residents. The message warned locals about fake toll payment texts, stating:</p>

                    <blockquote>“Great Falls, please be on the lookout for this text scam! A few local people have received a text referring to their vehicle having an ‘outstanding toll bill.’ This is a SCAM and is not coming from the City of Great Falls. Please do not click the link in the message.”</blockquote>

                    <h5>💡 How to Protect Yourself from This Scam?</h5>

                    <p>The <strong>FBI</strong> has provided clear instructions on how to avoid falling victim to this scam:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>✔️ <strong>Verify toll payments</strong> by checking your account on the official website of your toll service provider.</li>
                        <li>✔️ <strong>Do not click suspicious links</strong> in text messages demanding toll payments.</li>
                        <li>✔️ If you suspect fraud, <strong>contact customer support</strong> using a verified phone number.</li>
                        <li>✔️ If you have already clicked the link, <strong>secure your personal and financial information</strong> immediately.</li>
                        <li>✔️ Report the scam to the <strong>FTC or local law enforcement agencies</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>🔎 Who Is Behind the Scam?</h6>

                    <p>According to a report by <strong>KnowBe4</strong>, cybercriminal gangs are using advanced <strong>phishing kits</strong> developed by <strong>Chinese hacking groups</strong> to orchestrate these scams. The fraudsters design fake templates that mimic toll operators, shipping companies, tax agencies, and even immigration services. Their primary objective is to <strong>steal payment card details</strong> and misuse them for fraudulent transactions.</p>

                    <h5>📢 Similar Fake Text Scams in India</h5>

                    <p>Scammers have been using similar tactics in <strong>India</strong>. The <strong>Press Information Bureau's (PIB) Fact Check unit</strong> previously uncovered a widespread SMS scam where fraudsters impersonated <strong>India Post</strong>. The fake messages urged recipients to update their address details to avoid a return of a package. The PIB confirmed that these messages were entirely fabricated to trick individuals into revealing personal information.</p>

                    <h5>📝 Final Thoughts</h5>

                    <p>As cybercriminals continue to exploit digital communication channels, it is essential for users to stay vigilant. <strong>Never trust unsolicited messages demanding payments</strong>, and always verify information through official sources. The <strong>FBI, FTC, and cybersecurity agencies</strong> continue to monitor and issue alerts to protect the public from such scams.</p>
