        <h4>🛢️ Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Secures "Clean" Russian Crude Amid US Sanctions</h4>

        <h5>📌 India’s Strategic Oil Purchases from Russia</h5>
        <p>India has emerged as the <b>second-largest buyer</b> of Russian crude oil since the Ukraine conflict began in February 2022. Before the war, Russian oil accounted for less than <b>1%</b> of India’s total crude imports. Today, it makes up nearly <b>40%</b> of total oil purchases, driven by <b>discounted pricing</b> due to Western sanctions.</p>

        <h5>🔺 US Sanctions & Their Impact on Russian Oil Trade</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🚨 The US recently imposed <b>new sanctions</b> on Russian oil trade, targeting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Major oil producers like <b>Gazprom Neft</b> and <b>Surgutneftegas</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>183 vessels</b> that have shipped Russian oil.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>⚠️ Russia had been using a "<b>shadow fleet</b>"—tankers insured by its own companies—to bypass the <b>$60 per barrel price cap</b> imposed by the G7 nations, EU, and Australia.</li>
            <li>⛴️ <b>Sanctioned tankers</b> will no longer be allowed to dock at Indian ports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💡 Indian Oil's Strategy: Buying "Clean" Russian Crude</h5>
        <p>IOC Chairman <b>Arvindar Singh Sahney</b> clarified that Indian oil firms will continue to purchase Russian crude but only from <b>"clean" sources</b> that do not violate US sanctions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>✅ Indian firms will contract oil shipments with <b>sanction-free tankers</b> that have <b>proper insurance</b>.</li>
            <li>🛳️ Russian oil purchases are on a <b>delivered basis</b>, meaning suppliers must arrange transportation.</li>
            <li>🔄 If necessary, Indian refiners will <b>increase crude imports</b> from the Middle East and other sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📉 Russia’s Oil Discount Shrinking</h5>
        <p>Sanctions have forced Russia to offer <b>deep discounts</b> on its <b>Urals grade crude</b>. Initially, this discount was substantial, but it has now fallen to just <b>$2-3 per barrel</b>. Over time:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📉 In the first year of sanctions, Russia lost <b>23%</b> of its monthly oil revenue.</li>
            <li>📈 In the second year, losses dropped to just <b>9%</b>, as Russia <b>built a shadow fleet</b> to bypass the price cap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🔮 What Lies Ahead for India’s Oil Imports?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🛢️ If Russian supplies are disrupted, India may turn to <b>Middle Eastern oil</b> to meet demand.</li>
            <li>💰 The key concern for India is the <b>loss of discounts</b> on Russian oil rather than a supply shortage.</li>
            <li>📊 Despite sanctions, <b>Rosneft</b>, Russia’s primary supplier to India, remains unaffected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📌 Final Verdict: India’s Energy Security Stays Intact</h5>
        <p>While new sanctions add complications, India’s strategic planning ensures <b>no immediate disruption</b> to oil supply. However, <b>discounted Russian crude</b> may soon become a thing of the past.</p>
