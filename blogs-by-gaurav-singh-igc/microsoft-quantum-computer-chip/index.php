        <h4>🧪 Microsoft Unveils Majorana 1: Quantum Computers Now ‘Years, Not Decades’ Away</h4>

        <p><b>Microsoft</b> has announced a groundbreaking breakthrough in <strong>quantum computing</strong> with the introduction of the <b>Majorana 1 chip</b>. The tech giant claims this chip proves that <b>practical quantum computing</b> is much closer than previously thought—just "years, not decades" away.</p>

        <h5>🔹 What is the Majorana 1 Chip?</h5>

        <p>The <b>Majorana 1</b> is <strong>Microsoft’s first quantum computing chip</strong>, developed to accelerate the race toward building scalable quantum systems. The chip utilizes <b>topological qubits</b>, a technology that promises <b>greater stability and reduced error rates</b>, which have long been barriers to quantum computing adoption.</p>

        <h6>🔹 Key Features of the Majorana 1 Chip</h6>

        <ul>
            <li><b>⚡ Uses Topological Qubits:</b> More stable and resistant to noise.</li>
            <li><b>🧪 Years, Not Decades Away:</b> Microsoft predicts quantum computing is much closer than expected.</li>
            <li><b>🔬 Breakthrough in Quantum Stability:</b> Addresses previous quantum error correction issues.</li>
            <li><b>🌍 Real-World Applications:</b> Designed for medicine, chemistry, cryptography, and AI.</li>
