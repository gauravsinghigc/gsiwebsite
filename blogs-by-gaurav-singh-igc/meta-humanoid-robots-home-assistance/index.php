        <h4>🤖 Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Eyes Humanoid Robots for Home Assistance</h4>

        <h5>🚀 Meta Enters the Humanoid Robotics Space</h5>
        <p><b>Meta</b>, the tech giant owned by <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>, is reportedly forming a new team within its <b>Reality Labs</b> division to develop both hardware and software for <b>humanoid robots</b>. According to a recent <b>Bloomberg</b> report, this initiative aims to create <b>AI-powered home assistants</b> capable of performing household tasks.</p>

        <p>Instead of manufacturing robots in-house, <b>Meta</b> is looking to develop <b>AI models, sensors, and software</b> that can be licensed to robotics companies. The company is currently in discussions with <b>Unitree Robotics</b> and <b>Figure AI</b> to develop a Meta-branded humanoid robot.</p>

        <h5>🔬 Meta’s Robotics Vision: More Like Android, Less Like Tesla</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>⚙️ Meta will develop <b>AI-driven software</b> and <b>sensor technologies</b> instead of building robots from scratch.</li>
            <li>🏠 The goal is to integrate <b>humanoid robots</b> into smart homes for <b>household assistance</b>.</li>
            <li>🤝 Meta is exploring <b>partnerships</b> with robotics companies like <b>Unitree Robotics</b> and <b>Figure AI</b>.</li>
            <li>📱 The approach is similar to how <b>Google</b> and <b>Qualcomm</b> dominate the smartphone market with <b>Android</b> and <b>Snapdragon chips</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🧠 Meta’s AI & Reality Labs Investment</h4>
        <p>In an internal memo, <strong>Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth</strong> emphasized that the company’s AI and <b>Reality Labs</b> technologies are already aligned with humanoid robotics. The company has invested <b>hundreds of billions</b> into Reality Labs over the years, developing products like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🎮 <b>Meta Quest VR headsets</b></li>
            <li>🕶️ <b>Ray-Ban smart glasses</b></li>
            <li>🤖 <b>AI-powered virtual assistants</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>💰 This year, Meta plans to allocate <b>$65 billion</b> towards AI infrastructure, smart home devices, and <b>humanoid robotics research</b>.</p>

        <h5>👨‍💻 The Team Behind the Project</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🛠️ The humanoid robotics project will be led by <b>Marc Whitten</b>, who previously worked on <b>GM’s Cruise robotaxi</b>.</li>
            <li>👥 Meta plans to <b>hire 100 engineers</b> this year to develop its humanoid robotics technology.</li>
            <li>🧪 The company will <b>build prototypes</b> to refine AI and sensor integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📢 How Does This Compare to Apple’s Robot Plans?</h4>
        <p>Meta isn’t the only tech giant exploring robotics. Recently, <b>Apple</b> introduced a framework called <b>EMOTION</b>, designed to teach robots <b>human-like expressions</b> and <b>gestures</b>. However, Apple is focusing on both <b>humanoid and non-humanoid robots</b>.</p>

                <td>Humanoid robots for home assistance</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Apple</b></td>
                <td>Developing both humanoid & non-humanoid robots</td>
                <td>EMOTION framework for expressive AI interactions</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h5>🔮 The Future of Humanoid Robotics</h5>
        <p>Meta’s humanoid robot project is still in the <b>early research phase</b>, with commercial availability expected <b>several years down the line</b>. As AI and robotics technology advance, Meta aims to play a central role in shaping the <b>next-generation smart home ecosystem</b>.</p>
