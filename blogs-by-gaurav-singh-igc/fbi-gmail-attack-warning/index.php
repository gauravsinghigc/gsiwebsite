                            <li>💰 In <strong>2022</strong> alone, <strong>$8.8 billion</strong> was stolen through online scams, as per the <strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</strong>.</li>
                            <li>📈 The latest <strong>Hoxhunt Phishing Trends Report</strong> (published on February 6 by Forbes) shows that phishing attacks bypassing security filters have surged by <strong>49%</strong> since 2022.</li>
                            <li>🤖 AI-generated phishing emails now account for nearly <strong>5%</strong> of all phishing attempts.</li>
                            <li>📩 Gmail inboxes remain a primary target for hackers, as compromising one account can expose an entire <strong>Google ecosystem</strong>, including <strong>financial and personal data</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The FBI warns that phishing emails often appear to be from legitimate businesses, asking users to <strong>update or verify personal information</strong>. These emails may contain links leading to <strong>spoofed websites</strong> that closely resemble actual banking or credit card portals, tricking users into entering sensitive details.</p>

                        <h4>💡 What the FBI Recommends</h4>

                        <h5>🚫 Don't Click Anything Suspicious</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>🔗 Never click on links or open attachments from **unsolicited emails or text messages**.</li>
                            <li>📞 If you receive a message asking for sensitive details, look up the company’s contact information **independently** and call them to verify.</li>
                            <li>🔍 Carefully inspect the **email address, URL, and spelling** in all correspondence—scammers use slight variations to deceive users.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <blockquote>
                            <em>“You might receive an email that looks like it’s from a legitimate business, asking you to update or verify your personal details. Once you click the link, you're redirected to a fake website designed to steal your data.”</em> – <strong>FBI Cybercrime Division</strong>
