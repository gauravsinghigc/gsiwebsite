        <h4>🥃 <b>Trump’s Tariff War: Indian Liquor Industry Protests as Import Duty on Bourbon Slashed</b></h4>

        <p>📢 <b>India’s liquor industry</b> has raised strong objections to the government's decision to <b>slash import duties on bourbon whisky</b> from <b>150% to 50%</b>. The move, aimed at easing trade tensions with the <b>United States</b>, has sparked concerns among Indian manufacturers, who argue that the decision could harm the domestic <b>alcoholic beverage sector</b>.</p>

        <h5>📌 <b>Why Is India Reducing Import Duties on Bourbon?</b></h5>
        <p>As part of the broader strategy to appease <b>U.S. President Donald Trump</b> ahead of <b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States</b>, the Indian government has implemented significant <b>tariff cuts</b> on various imports, including bourbon whisky. The decision is expected to facilitate a <b>potential trade deal</b> between the two nations.</p>

        <p>🛑 However, the <b>Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC)</b> has urged state governments to withdraw all <b>excise concessions</b> for imported liquor, citing fears that the decision could disrupt the balance in the domestic market.</p>

        <h5>⚠️ <b>Indian Liquor Industry’s Concerns</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🛑 <b>Dumping of Imported Liquor:</b> Industry experts warn that lower tariffs could lead to an influx of <b>cheap foreign spirits</b>, threatening <b>Indian whisky, rum, and wine producers</b>.</li>
            <li>🌍 <b>Non-Tariff Barriers Affecting Indian Liquor Exports:</b> While India is reducing tariffs, countries like the UK impose <b>strict regulations</b> such as a <b>three-year maturation requirement</b> for whisky, preventing Indian brands from competing fairly in global markets.</li>
            <li>💸 <b>Impact on State Revenues:</b> The <b>alcohol industry</b> contributes over <b>₹3 lakh crore</b> annually to state governments through taxes and excise duties.</li>
            <li>🏭 <b>Threat to Domestic Liquor Manufacturers:</b> The reduction in import duties could lead to foreign brands <b>undercutting Indian whisky</b> and other spirits, hurting locally produced premium brands.</li>
            <li>🛠 <b>Request for Gradual Tariff Reduction:</b> CIABC has suggested that the duty cuts should be implemented gradually over a <b>10-year period</b> rather than an immediate reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💬 <b>CIABC Director General Anant S. Iyer’s Statement</b></h5>
        <p>📢 <i>“The government needs to <b>safeguard Indian liquor manufacturers</b> when deciding on customs duty cuts and other <b>Free Trade Agreement (FTA) concessions</b>. We are requesting state governments to <b>withdraw excise concessions</b> for imported liquor to prevent a double blow to domestic producers.”</i> – <b>Anant S. Iyer, CIABC</b></p>

        <h5>🌍 <b>Trade Disputes: India vs. Western Markets</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🇬🇧 <b>United Kingdom:</b> India has been contesting the UK’s <b>three-year maturation rule</b> for whisky, which blocks <b>Indian brands</b> from entering the British market.</li>
            <li>🇪🇺 <b>European Union:</b> Indian liquor exports face multiple <b>non-tariff barriers</b> in <b>France, Germany, and Italy</b>.</li>
            <li>🇺🇸 <b>United States:</b> India’s move to cut tariffs on bourbon is a step towards a <b>larger trade negotiation</b> with Washington.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📉 <b>Impact on Domestic Brands & Employment</b></h5>
        <p>💰 <b>The Indian alcoholic beverage industry</b> is a <b>major revenue generator</b> and <b>job provider</b>. Lower import tariffs could affect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🏭 <b>Domestic liquor production</b> and investments in <b>premium Indian whisky brands</b>.</li>
            <li>👨‍🌾 <b>Employment in distilleries</b>, bottling plants, and related industries.</li>
            <li>🚜 <b>Agriculture sector</b> that supplies raw materials like sugarcane, barley, and grapes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🔮 <b>What’s Next for India’s Liquor Trade Policy?</b></h5>
        <p>🇮🇳 While India is <b>reducing tariffs on imported alcohol</b>, industry leaders are demanding <b>reciprocity from Western nations</b>. They want countries like the <b>UK and the U.S.</b> to remove trade barriers and recognize <b>Indian whisky as premium-quality liquor</b>.</p>

        <h5>📢 <b>Final Thoughts</b></h5>
        <p>⚖️ India’s tariff cut on bourbon whisky is a strategic move to <b>strengthen U.S.-India trade relations</b>, but it has <b>ignited protests</b> from the domestic liquor industry. Whether India will negotiate <b>better market access</b> for its own brands remains to be seen.</p>
