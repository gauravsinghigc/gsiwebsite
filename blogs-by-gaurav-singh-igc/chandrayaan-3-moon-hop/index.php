        <h4>🚀 How Chandrayaan-3 Lander Made a Surprise Moon ‘Hop’</h4>

        <p>The successful <b>hop experiment</b> by the <strong>Chandrayaan-3 lander</strong>, Vikram, took the scientific community by surprise. <b>ISRO</b> had never publicly discussed this maneuver before, and it was not part of the original mission plan.</p>

        <p>However, after the successful <strong>soft landing on the Moon in August 2023</strong>, ISRO scientists found themselves with an unexpected situation—<b>Vikram still had leftover fuel</b>. While some researchers suggested using it for a new experiment, others were hesitant since the mission had already achieved its primary objectives.</p>

        <h5>🔹 Why Did Vikram Lander Perform a ‘Hop’ on the Moon?</h5>

        <p>With unused propellant still available, ISRO decided to test whether the lander could <b>lift off and land again</b> on the Moon’s surface. This idea was similar to <strong>NASA’s Apollo Lunar Module ascent</strong>, which had to launch astronauts back into lunar orbit.</p>

        <h6>🔹 Key Objectives of the Hop Experiment:</h6>

        <ul>
            <li><b>🚀 Testing Reusability:</b> Evaluating if a lander can be used for multiple Moon landings.</li>
            <li><b>🌕 Lunar Surface Interaction:</b> Understanding how <b>low-gravity conditions</b> affect short flights.</li>
            <li><b>🛰️ Future Moon Missions:</b> Collecting data for potential <b>sample return missions</b> and crewed lunar landers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📢 Chandrayaan-3’s Hop Experiment: What Happened?</h5>

        <p>On <b>September 3, 2023</b>, just before the mission concluded, ISRO scientists activated Vikram’s thrusters, making it <b>rise 40 cm</b> above the Moon’s surface before safely landing at a new location <b>30 to 40 cm away</b>.</p>

        <h6>🔹 How the Hop Experiment Worked:</h6>

        <ul>
            <li><b>🔥 Thruster Activation:</b> Vikram’s engines fired with controlled force.</li>
            <li><b>🛑 Hover & Descent:</b> The lander briefly hovered before a smooth touchdown.</li>
            <li><b>🛰️ Scientific Observations:</b> Sensors analyzed the <b>lunar dust movement</b> and lander stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>⚖️ Comparing Chandrayaan-3’s Hop to Other Lunar Missions</h5>

        <p>While ISRO’s hop was a spontaneous experiment, similar maneuvers have been performed in past Moon missions.</p>
