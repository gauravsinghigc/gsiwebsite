        <h4>🤖 Apple May Be Developing Both Humanoid & Non-Humanoid Consumer Robots</h4>

        <h5>📢 Apple’s AI-Powered Robotics Research</h5>
        <p><strong>Apple</strong> is reportedly working on <b>humanoid and non-humanoid robots</b> that could integrate into its <b>smart home ecosystem</b>. The project is still in the <b>early proof-of-concept (POC) stage</b> and is being internally tested before any final decisions are made.</p>

        <h5>🧠 Apple’s EMOTION Framework for AI Robotics</h5>
        <p>As part of its robotics research, Apple has introduced a new framework called <b>EMOTION</b>, which enables robots to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>😊 <b>Mimic human facial expressions</b> for realistic interactions.</li>
            <li>🖐️ <b>Replicate human hand gestures</b> and body movements.</li>
            <li>💬 <b>Engage in non-verbal communication</b> for more natural social interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔍 Apple’s Robotics Focus: Functionality Over Appearance?</h4>
        <p>According to <b>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</b>, the company might prioritize <b>functionality and perception</b> over making robots look human. Apple’s research paper also uses the term <b>“non-anthropomorphic”</b>, hinting at the possibility of <b>non-humanoid robotic designs</b>.</p>

        <h5>📌 How Apple Is Training Its AI Robots</h5>
        <p>Apple is using a <b>LLM-based approach</b> (Large Language Model) to generate expressive motion sequences for humanoid robots. The company has also leveraged the <b>Vision Pro headset</b> to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📡 <b>Collect motion demonstrations</b> for training robots.</li>
            <li>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 <b>Incorporate human feedback</b> into their AI learning models.</li>
            <li>🎥 <b>Enhance social interaction understanding</b> in robots.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📅 Expected Timeline for Apple Robots</h4>
        <p>📆 Kuo estimates that <b>Apple’s consumer robots</b> could enter <b>mass production by 2028</b>. However, since the project is still in its early stages, there’s a possibility of delays or even cancellation.</p>
