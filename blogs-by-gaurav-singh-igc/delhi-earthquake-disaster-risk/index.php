        <h4>🏢 <b>Delhi Can’t Handle a ‘Great Earthquake Disaster’ – Where Does the Problem Lie?</b></h4>

        <p>The recent <strong>4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi</strong> on <strong>February 17</strong> has reignited fears about the city’s preparedness for a <strong>major seismic disaster</strong>. Residents reported strong tremors that shook buildings for several seconds, highlighting the vulnerability of Delhi’s infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Delhi is located in <strong>Seismic Zone IV</strong>, meaning it is highly prone to <strong>earthquake damage</strong>. However, experts warn that the city is <strong>not equipped to handle a major earthquake</strong>. According to the <strong>Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)</strong>, a large number of buildings do not comply with <strong>earthquake-resistant construction standards</strong>, making them highly vulnerable to collapse in case of a strong quake.</p>

        <h5>🚨 <b>Why Is Delhi at High Risk?</b></h5>

        <p><b>Anubrotto Kumar (Dunu) Roy</b>, Director of the <b>Hazards Centre (New Delhi)</b>, explains that the current condition of <b>Delhi-NCR’s buildings and infrastructure is “very poor.”</b> He identifies two major problems:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🏗️ <strong>Rapid Growth of High-Rise Buildings</strong> – "Until the 1990s, Delhi was a low-rise, high-density city. Most buildings were 2-3 stories high, which made them relatively safe. But now, high-rises dominate the cityscape, increasing earthquake risks."</li>
            <li>🏠 <strong>Unplanned Urbanization & Unauthorized Colonies</strong> – "A large portion of Delhi’s population lives in unauthorized housing, lacking proper structural integrity and safety approvals."</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Anil Bansal</b>, an urban planning expert, further elaborates:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📉 <strong>Weak enforcement of building regulations</strong> has led to unsafe construction practices.</li>
            <li>🏚️ <strong>Millions of residents live in structurally weak buildings</strong>, especially in slums and unauthorized colonies.</li>
            <li>🚧 <strong>Poor planning and lack of earthquake-resistant infrastructure</strong> worsen the problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🛠️ <b>How Can Delhi Prepare for a Major Earthquake?</b></h5>

        <p>Experts emphasize that while earthquakes cannot be prevented, <strong>stronger urban planning, stricter building regulations, and retrofitting old buildings</strong> can significantly reduce casualties.</p>

        <h5>🏗️ <b>Solutions for Earthquake Safety</b></h5>

        <ul>
            <li>📐 <strong>Triangulation & Earthquake-Resistant Design</strong> – Implementing stable triangular structures enhances safety.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <strong>Retrofitting Existing Buildings</strong> – Strengthening weak structures can prevent collapses.</li>
            <li>🚨 <strong>Decentralized Emergency Response</strong> – Creating local disaster response teams at every 100th house.</li>
            <li>🏛️ <strong>Stronger Government Policy & Strict Building Code Enforcement</strong></li>
            <li>📢 <strong>Public Awareness Campaigns</strong> – Teaching residents about <strong>earthquake preparedness</strong> and emergency evacuation procedures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>⚠️ <b>What Can Residents Do?</b></h5>

        <p>While government action is crucial, individuals must also take steps to ensure safety:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🏠 <strong>Ensure homes meet seismic safety standards</strong></li>
            <li>🔦 <strong>Keep an earthquake emergency kit ready</strong> (food, water, flashlight, first-aid, etc.)</li>
            <li>🚪 <strong>Identify safe spots at home</strong> (door frames, under sturdy tables)</li>
            <li>📢 <strong>Stay informed about earthquake drills</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📢 <b>Urgent Action Needed!</b></h5>

        <p><b>“Delhi possesses the necessary policies and frameworks to mitigate seismic risks, but without immediate and sustained action, a catastrophe is inevitable,”</b> warns Bansal.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🏗️ <strong>Strict enforcement of earthquake-resistant construction standards</strong></li>
            <li>👷 <strong>Improved urban planning & infrastructure development</strong></li>
            <li>📢 <strong>Greater public awareness & preparedness programs</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>🔴 <strong>The recent tremors are a wake-up call. Delhi must act now before a devastating earthquake strikes!</strong></p>
