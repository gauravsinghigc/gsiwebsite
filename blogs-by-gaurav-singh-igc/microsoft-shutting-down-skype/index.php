        <h4>📢 End of an Icon: Microsoft to Shut Down Skype Permanently</h4>

        <p>After two decades of connecting people across the globe, <strong>Microsoft</strong> has officially announced the permanent shutdown of <strong>Skype</strong>. The once-revolutionary internet calling service will sign off for good on <strong>May 5, 2025</strong>, marking the end of an era in digital communication.</p>

        <h4>📉 Why is Microsoft Shutting Down Skype?</h4>

        <p>Skype, which once dominated the online communication space, has struggled to keep up with modern competitors like <strong>Zoom</strong> and <strong>Slack</strong>. Microsoft has chosen to focus on <strong>Teams</strong>, its business-oriented collaboration platform, rather than investing further in Skype’s revival.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📅 <strong>Launched in 2003:</strong> Skype revolutionized voice and video calls over the internet, replacing traditional landlines.</li>
            <li>💰 <strong>Acquired by Microsoft in 2011:</strong> Purchased for <strong>$8.5 billion</strong>, outbidding Google and Facebook.</li>
            <li>📉 <strong>Declining Popularity:</strong> Skype’s technology was desktop-focused, struggling to adapt to the smartphone era.</li>
            <li>🚀 <strong>Rise of Microsoft Teams:</strong> By 2024, Teams had <strong>320 million monthly users</strong>, far surpassing Skype.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔄 What Happens to Existing Skype Users?</h4>

        <p>For long-time Skype users, Microsoft has planned a seamless transition:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🔑 <strong>Use Skype Credentials for Teams:</strong> Users can log into <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> using their existing Skype accounts.</li>
            <li>📂 <strong>Automatic Chat & Contact Migration:</strong> Conversations and contacts will transfer to Teams without manual effort.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Free Access to Teams:</strong> Skype users will be able to use Teams at no additional cost.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🤔 Another Microsoft Misfire?</h4>

        <p>Skype’s shutdown adds to the list of <strong>Microsoft’s discontinued projects</strong> like <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong>. While Skype played a pivotal role in digital communication, it struggled to evolve with emerging trends. Instead of competing with modern apps, Microsoft is betting on <strong>Teams</strong> as its primary communication tool.</p>

        <h4>📞 Say Goodbye to Skype</h4>

        <p>For those who still remember the nostalgic <strong>Skype ringtone</strong>, now is the time to make one last call. With Microsoft pulling the plug, Skype is set to fade into history—leaving behind a legacy of transforming global communication.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“If you still hear the ‘doo-doo-doo’ ringtone in your head, now’s your last chance to answer.”</p>
