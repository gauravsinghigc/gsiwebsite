        <h4>📉 Qualcomm’s Decline: How It Lost Its Edge in Mobile & AI Computing</h4>

        <p>Once the undisputed leader in <strong>mobile processors</strong>, <strong>Qualcomm</strong> has struggled to maintain its dominance as competition from <strong>Apple, MediaTek, and AMD</strong> reshaped the semiconductor industry. While the company continues to innovate, its inability to capitalize on emerging trends has allowed rivals to gain ground.</p>

        <h5>🔍 How Qualcomm Lost Its Lead in Mobile Processors</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>📱 <strong>Apple’s A-Series Chips:</strong> Apple’s in-house silicon outperformed Snapdragon in <strong>efficiency and raw power</strong>.</li>
            <li>⚡ <strong>MediaTek’s Dimensity Surge:</strong> MediaTek’s focus on <strong>affordable high-performance chips</strong> forced manufacturers to rethink their reliance on Qualcomm.</li>
            <li>📡 <strong>5G Struggles:</strong> Despite pioneering <strong>5G modem technology</strong>, Qualcomm faced licensing disputes and increasing competition from <strong>Samsung and Apple</strong>.</li>
            <li>🌎 <strong>Geopolitical & Supply Chain Issues:</strong> Trade restrictions and chip shortages further complicated Qualcomm’s position.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>💻 Qualcomm in the AI PC Era: What Went Wrong?</h4>

        <p>Qualcomm initially had a strong lead with <strong>Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs</strong>, but <strong>AMD and Intel</strong> quickly caught up, cutting into its advantage.</p>

        <h5>⚠️ Why Copilot+ PCs Failed to Gain Traction</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>🤖 <strong>Microsoft’s AI Features Fell Flat:</strong> The key AI tools, <strong>Cocreator and Recall</strong>, were either unappealing or poorly positioned.</li>
            <li>🏢 <strong>Enterprise Sales Struggles:</strong> Qualcomm’s Copilot+ PCs had <strong>compatibility issues</strong>, making them less attractive for businesses.</li>
            <li>📣 <strong>Lack of Marketing:</strong> Unlike AMD and Intel, Qualcomm failed to execute a targeted marketing campaign to drive adoption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>📢 What Qualcomm Should Have Done Differently</h6>

        <ul>
            <li>⚡ <strong>Highlight Key Advantages:</strong> Qualcomm had better <strong>battery life</strong> and superior <strong>wireless networking</strong> but failed to capitalize on them.</li>
            <li>📶 <strong>Push 5G Laptops:</strong> Qualcomm missed the opportunity to create a <strong>5G-enabled AI laptop</strong> that leveraged its strengths.</li>
            <li>📈 <strong>Market to Niche Users:</strong> Targeting <strong>small business owners, influencers, and consultants</strong> could have helped overcome compatibility concerns.</li>
        </ul>
