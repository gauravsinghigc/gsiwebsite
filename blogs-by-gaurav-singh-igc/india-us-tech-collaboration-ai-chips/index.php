        <h4>🤝 India-US to Deepen Tech Collaboration with AI, Semiconductor & Supply Chain Focus</h4>

        <h5>📌 Key Highlights</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🇮🇳🤝🇺🇸 India and the US to prepare a roadmap for accelerating <b>AI infrastructure</b> by the end of the year.</li>
            <li>💰 US-origin AI infrastructure to expand in India, enabling <b>investments in data centers</b> and <b>access to AI computing power</b>.</li>
            <li>🔬 Strengthened collaboration in <b>defense, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology, energy, and space</b>.</li>
            <li>⚙️ The new initiative will support <b>trusted and resilient supply chains</b> for semiconductors, minerals, advanced materials, and pharmaceuticals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🚀 US-India TRUST Initiative</h5>
        <p>Prime Minister <b>Narendra Modi</b> and US President <b>Donald Trump</b> have launched the <b>Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology (TRUST) Initiative</b>. The initiative aims to foster government, private sector, and academic collaboration to drive innovation in critical technologies.</p>

        <h5>🌍 Key Goals of the Initiative</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>📈 Strengthening <b>AI and semiconductor infrastructure</b> in India.</li>
            <li>🏭 Promoting <b>US-India private industry partnerships</b> to enhance AI computing power and <b>build next-gen data centers</b>.</li>
            <li>🛡️ Encouraging <b>verified technology vendors</b> and ensuring protection of sensitive technologies.</li>
            <li>💻 Enhancing <b>AI model development</b> and building applications for societal challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🤖 AI & Semiconductor Expansion in India</h5>
        <p>India is currently in the process of procuring <b>19,000 GPUs</b> for AI development at subsidized costs for startups and researchers. Meanwhile, US giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, and Oracle are investing <b>$500 billion</b> in AI infrastructure under the <b>Stargate Project</b>.</p>

        <h5>⚠️ The DeepSeek Factor & US Export Rules</h5>
        <p>The rise of <b>China’s DeepSeek</b>, an open-source AI model that rivals OpenAI at <b>a fraction of the cost</b>, has disrupted the global AI race. This has raised concerns about AI competitiveness and national security in the US.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🇺🇸 The Biden administration proposed an <b>AI hardware export restriction</b> under the ‘Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion’.</li>
            <li>🚫 India falls under a <b>middle-tier classification</b>, facing limits on the number of AI chips it can import from the US.</li>
            <li>🔒 Only <b>trusted and secure environments</b> will be allowed to host high-performance AI computing power.</li>
            <li>📊 Currently, India can import <b>50,000 advanced AI chips</b> through 2027, with potential to double if agreements are reached.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🔗 Strengthening Supply Chains & Manufacturing</h5>
        <p>The two nations will work towards building <b>secure semiconductor and critical material supply chains</b>, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🏭 Expanding <b>semiconductor manufacturing</b> in India.</li>
            <li>💊 Increasing production of <b>active pharmaceutical ingredients</b> to reduce dependency on single-source suppliers.</li>
            <li>🔧 Reducing trade barriers and improving <b>high-tech commerce</b> between India and the US.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>🔮 What Lies Ahead?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>🇮🇳 India could see <b>major AI investments</b> from US companies, improving access to computing resources.</li>
            <li>🛠️ The <b>AI export restrictions</b> could be relaxed under Trump’s leadership, benefiting India’s AI industry.</li>
            <li>📈 Increased collaboration in semiconductors and pharmaceuticals will strengthen India’s position as a <b>global manufacturing hub</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>📌 Final Verdict: A New Era of US-India Tech Partnership</h5>
        <p>The India-US TRUST Initiative marks a <b>significant step</b> towards deeper technological collaboration, with AI, semiconductors, and supply chain resilience at its core. If successful, this could <b>redefine India's AI and manufacturing landscape</b>, securing its place in the global digital economy.</p>
