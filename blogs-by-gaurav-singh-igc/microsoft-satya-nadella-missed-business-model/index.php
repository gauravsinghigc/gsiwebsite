        <h4>💡 "We Missed the Biggest Business Model on the Web" – Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</h4>
        <p><b>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</b> recently admitted that the company failed to recognize the biggest business model on the internet—<b>search engines</b>. In a conversation with <strong>Indian YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel</strong> on a podcast, Nadella reflected on how <b>Google</b> successfully capitalized on search, whereas Microsoft overlooked the opportunity.</p>

        <h5>🔍 Google’s Search Engine Success – A Missed Opportunity for Microsoft</h5>
        <p>During the discussion, Nadella highlighted how <b>Google</b> mastered <b>web search monetization</b> and built a dominant business empire around it.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Who would have thought that search would be the biggest winner in organizing the web?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He emphasized that understanding <b>technological trends</b> alone isn't enough; companies must also recognize where <b>value creation</b> happens.</p>

        <p><strong>“That’s one lesson learned for me: you have to not only get the tech trend right, you also have to get where the value is going to be created with that trend. These business model shifts are probably tougher than even the tech trend changes.”</strong></p>

        <h5>⚛️ Microsoft’s Quantum Computing Breakthrough – The "Transistor Moment"</h5>
        <p>While discussing technology, Nadella also introduced <b>Microsoft’s latest quantum computing milestone</b>—the <b>Majorana 1 quantum processor</b>. Built using a <b>topoconductor</b> instead of a <b>semiconductor</b>, it represents a groundbreaking shift in quantum computing.</p>

        <h6>💡 What Makes Majorana 1 Special?</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>🔬 <b>First quantum processor</b> using a <strong>topoconductor</strong>.</li>
            <li>🖥️ Capable of computations that <b>classical computers</b> cannot perform.</li>
            <li>🚀 A step toward building a <b>million-qubit quantum computer</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“To think that we are able to build something like a million-qubit quantum computer in a thing of this size is just unbelievable.” – <strong>Satya Nadella</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h5>🚀 Elon Musk Praises Microsoft’s Quantum Leap</h5>
        <p><b>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</b> acknowledged the breakthrough in a post on <b>X (formerly Twitter)</b>, stating:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“More and more breakthroughs with quantum computing….” – <strong>Elon Musk</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h5>🔮 The Future of Quantum Computing</h5>
        <p>Microsoft’s quantum leap with <b>Majorana 1</b> could mark the beginning of a new era in computing. Experts believe that a <b>million-qubit quantum computer</b> will eventually outperform all current computers combined, solving complex problems in <b>seconds</b> rather than <b>years</b>.</p>

        <h6>💭 What’s Next?</h6>
        <p>While Microsoft may have missed the <b>search engine revolution</b>, its progress in <b>quantum computing</b> could position it as a leader in the next technological breakthrough. With advancements like <b>Majorana 1</b>, the race toward a fully functional <b>utility-scale quantum computer</b> is accelerating.</p>
