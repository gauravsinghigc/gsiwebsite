            <h4>üèè RCB to Announce New Captain for IPL 2025 on Thursday</h4>
            <p><strong>Bengaluru:</strong> The wait is almost over! <strong>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)</strong> are set to unveil their new <strong>captain for IPL 2025</strong> on Thursday in Bengaluru, following the departure of former skipper <strong>Faf du Plessis</strong>.</p>

            <h5>ü§î Who Will Lead RCB in IPL 2025?</h5>
            <p>While the official announcement is yet to be made, reports suggest that <strong>Virat Kohli</strong> is the frontrunner for the role. Kohli previously captained RCB from <strong>2013 to 2021</strong> and even led the team in a few matches in IPL 2023. Another potential candidate is <strong>Rajat Patidar</strong>, who has been with the franchise since 2021 and captained Madhya Pradesh in domestic tournaments.</p>

            <h6>üì¢ Why Does RCB Need a New Captain?</h6>
            <p>RCB opted not to retain <strong>Faf du Plessis</strong>, who led the team for <strong>three seasons (2022-2024)</strong>. At the <strong>IPL 2025 auction</strong>, they did not bid for the South African veteran, and he was picked by <strong>Delhi Capitals</strong> at his base price. With his departure, the franchise is now on the lookout for a new leader.</p>

            <h5>üèÜ Kohli‚Äôs Captaincy Record at RCB</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Led RCB for <strong>143 IPL matches</strong> (second-most after MS Dhoni)</li>
                <li>Record: <strong>68 wins, 71 losses, 4 no-results</strong></li>
                <li>Took RCB to the <strong>IPL 2016 final</strong> with a record <strong>973-run season</strong></li>
                <li>Finished as the <strong>highest run-scorer in IPL 2024</strong> with <strong>741 runs at 154.69 SR</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h6>üìå RCB, KKR & DC Yet to Name Captains</h6>
            <p>With IPL 2025 approaching, <strong>RCB, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Delhi Capitals (DC)</strong> are the only teams yet to confirm their captains. <strong>Shreyas Iyer</strong>, who led KKR last season, has moved to <strong>Punjab Kings</strong>, while <strong>Rishabh Pant</strong> will now captain <strong>Lucknow Super Giants</strong>.</p>
