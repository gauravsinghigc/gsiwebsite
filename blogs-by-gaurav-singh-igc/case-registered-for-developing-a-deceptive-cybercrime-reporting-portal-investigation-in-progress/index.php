        <h4>Case Registered for Developing a Fake Cybercrime Reporting Portal, Investigation in Progress</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">Cybercrooks are finding new ways to deceive unsuspecting people. The Central Division <strong>Cyber Crime</strong> police have registered a case against an unidentified person who created a fraudulent <strong>National Cybercrime</strong> reporting portal to exploit people in need of assistance.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Based on the complaint lodged by <strong>Srinivas R.</strong>, a police sub-inspector with the <strong>1930 Cyber Crime Helpline</strong>, the police on Monday registered an FIR against the unknown individual, charging him under section 318(2) (<strong>deceptively obtaining money</strong>, property, or an unfair advantage) and 318(4) (<strong>fraudulently inducing the delivery of property</strong>) for further investigation.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">According to the complainant, the 1930-cyber crime helpline was established to provide help to victims of cybercrimes and assist in filing cases through the <strong>NCRP portal</strong>.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">However, the helpline team discovered that someone had created a link under the banner "<strong>Cyber Fraud Online Complaint</strong> - <strong>Cyber Crime Complaint Number 7501141599</strong>, Customers Legal Advice (<a href="http://www.customerslegaladvice.in">www.customerslegaladvice.in</a>)" and promoted it as a sponsored ad on <strong>Google</strong>.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Recently, a <strong>victim of cybercrime</strong> fraud from Bagalkote called the number to report an incident on January 26. The person who responded to the call assured the victim of assistance and fraudulently charged ₹1,999 as a “fee.” The victim later reported the matter to the police.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">"This is a new form of <strong>cybercrime</strong>, and people should not be paying any money to report cybercrime incidents through the helpline," said a senior police officer.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">"We have created awareness statewide and at station levels on how to prevent cybercrimes and avoid falling for such scams. Anyone who demands money or seeks sensitive information like <strong>bank account details</strong> and personal IDs should be reported," the official added.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">The police are currently working on blocking the fraudulent link that was promoted on Google to prevent further harm, while efforts are underway to trace the accused using the <strong>money trail</strong>.</p>
