        </ul>

        <h5>🔍 Quantum Computing Error Rates: How PsiQuantum Stands Out</h5>
        <p>PsiQuantum has achieved competitive error rates in its quantum processors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ <b>Single-qubit operations</b>: <strong>0.02% error rate</strong></li>
            <li>✅ <b>Two-qubit operations</b>: <strong>0.8% error rate</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These figures rival the best in the industry, indicating that PsiQuantum's technology is moving toward <b>fault-tolerant quantum computing</b>.</p>

        <h4>🛠️ Fusion-Based Quantum Computing: PsiQuantum’s Secret Weapon</h4>
        <p>A key advantage PsiQuantum claims is its adoption of <strong>fusion-based quantum computing</strong>. This model makes <b>error correction more efficient</b>, helping the system maintain quantum coherence.</p>

        <h5>🌍 The Future of PsiQuantum: Scalability and Real-World Impact</h5>
        <p>PsiQuantum's collaboration with <b>GlobalFoundries</b> allows it to manufacture <strong>millions of quantum chips</strong>, making it one of the most scalable quantum computing initiatives to date. If successful, PsiQuantum’s approach could lead to:</p>
