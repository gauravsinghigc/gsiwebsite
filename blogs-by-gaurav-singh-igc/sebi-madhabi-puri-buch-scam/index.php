        <h4>‚öñÔ∏è Stock market scam: Charges against ex-SEBI head Madhabi Puri Buch</h4>

        <p>A special anti-corruption court in Mumbai has ordered the registration of a <strong>First Information Report (FIR)</strong> against top officials of the <strong>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)</strong>, including former Chairperson <strong>Madhabi Puri Buch</strong>, whole-time members <strong>Ashwani Bhatia</strong>, <strong>Ananth Narayan G</strong>, and <strong>Kamlesh Chandra Varshney</strong>. Additionally, <strong>Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)</strong> Chairman <strong>Pramod Agarwal</strong> and CEO <strong>Sundararaman Ramamurthy</strong> have also been named in the alleged <strong>stock market fraud and regulatory violation</strong> case.</p>

        <h5>üìå Court order and allegations</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The case was filed based on a petition by <strong>RTI journalist Sapan Shrivastava</strong>.</li>
            <li>The allegations claim that <strong>SEBI officials facilitated market manipulation</strong> and corporate fraud by allowing the listing of <strong>Cals Refineries</strong>, which was liquidated in <strong>2019</strong>.</li>
            <li>The special judge <strong>SE Bangar</strong> found the allegations serious enough to warrant an investigation under <strong>Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C</strong>, allowing a magistrate to order a police investigation.</li>
            <li>The case revolves around accusations of <strong>round-tripping, insider trading, and price manipulation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>üìâ SEBI's response to the allegations</h5>
        <p>Following the court‚Äôs order, <strong>SEBI</strong> strongly opposed the accusations and announced that it will challenge the FIR. In an official statement, SEBI clarified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The officials named in the case <strong>were not in their respective positions</strong> when the alleged violations occurred.</li>
            <li>The court <strong>passed the order without allowing SEBI to present its case</strong> or respond to the allegations.</li>
            <li>SEBI described <strong>Sapan Shrivastava</strong> as a ‚Äú<strong>habitual litigant</strong>‚Äù whose previous legal petitions have been dismissed, sometimes with imposed costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>üí∞ Cals Refineries and stock market fraud</h5>
        <p>The accusations focus on the alleged <strong>manipulation of Cals Refineries‚Äô stock</strong>. Key points include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The company‚Äôs promoters allegedly <strong>siphoned off public funds</strong> after listing.</li>
            <li>Despite non-compliance with regulatory norms, <strong>SEBI permitted its listing</strong>.</li>
            <li>The stock price saw abnormal movements, rising from <strong>‚Çπ0.07 to ‚Çπ0.29</strong> in <strong>2016</strong>, delivering <strong>314.2% returns</strong> to investors.</li>
            <li>In <strong>2021</strong>, SEBI imposed a fine of nearly <strong>‚Çπ17 crore</strong> on <strong>Cals Refineries</strong>, its officials, and another entity for <strong>manipulation in the issuance of global depository receipts (GDRs)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>üîé Legal consequences and ongoing investigation</h5>
        <p>The court noted that the evidence suggests <strong>regulatory lapses and collusion</strong>, making a full-fledged investigation necessary. SEBI officials and BSE executives may face legal action if the investigation proves <strong>gross negligence or corruption</strong>.</p>

        <h5>üì¢ What‚Äôs next?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SEBI and BSE</strong> plan to legally challenge the FIR.</li>
            <li>Authorities will investigate the alleged <strong>insider trading, price manipulation, and corporate fraud</strong>.</li>
            <li>If found guilty, those involved could face <strong>severe financial penalties</strong> and potential criminal charges.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stay updated on this developing story as further legal proceedings unfold.</p>
