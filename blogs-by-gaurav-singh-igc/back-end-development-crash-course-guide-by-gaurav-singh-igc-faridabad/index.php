        <h4>Back-End Development Crash Course Guide by Gaurav Singh (gauravsinghigc)</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">Back-end development is the server-side part of web development that involves creating and managing the functionality, databases, and server-side logic of a website or web application. It’s crucial for ensuring that the website’s front-end operates efficiently and can interact with databases and servers. In this crash course, you’ll learn the essential skills and technologies required to become a successful back-end developer.</p>

        <h5>1. What is Back-End Development?</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">Back-end development refers to the creation and maintenance of the server-side of web applications. It involves managing databases, handling user authentication, and ensuring that data is processed and served to the front-end seamlessly. The back-end developer ensures that the site runs smoothly by writing server-side code, handling database queries, and managing data storage and retrieval.</p>

        <h6>Key Technologies:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, Ruby</li>
