        <h4>🕶️ How This Indian Developer Created an AR Game for Snap’s Spectacles Glasses</h4>

        <h5>📢 Mumbai-Based Developer Builds “Sign of Doom” for AR Glasses</h5>
        <p><strong>Jeetesh Singh</strong>, a freelance <b>AR developer</b> from Mumbai, is among the first Indian developers to gain access to <b>Snap’s fifth-generation Spectacles</b>. His new AR game, <b>“Sign of Doom”</b>, is designed specifically for Snap’s <b>augmented reality-powered smart glasses</b>.</p>

        <p>👓 Snap Inc. aims to <b>expand the AR ecosystem</b> by supporting <b>young Lens creators</b> like Singh, leveraging their familiarity with <b>Lens Studio</b> to bring <b>interactive AR experiences</b> to Spectacles.</p>

        <h5>🎮 What Is “Sign of Doom”?</h5>
        <p><b>“Sign of Doom”</b> is a <b>first-person shooter</b> set in a futuristic 3D world where players must <b>fight off alien invaders</b> using mystical hand gestures.</p>

        <h6>📌 Game Features:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>🚀 <b>First-person shooter experience</b> in a fully immersive 3D space.</li>

        <h4>🔍 Challenges & Innovations in AR Game Development</h4>
        <p>Singh initially struggled with <b>finding the right UI and user interactions</b> for a <b>fully 3D gaming experience</b>. Unlike traditional mobile games where players interact via a <b>touchscreen</b>, Spectacles require <b>gesture-based interactions</b>.</p>

        <h5>🛠️ How He Overcame These Challenges</h5>

            <li>📡 Used <b>Snap’s Lens Studio</b> to develop and optimize interactions.</li>

            <li>🖌️ Created 3D models in Blender, with input from his cousin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📌 No Coding Background? You Can Still Build AR Experiences!</h4>
        <p>Singh emphasized that creating Lenses for Snapchat and Spectacles does <b>not require extensive coding skills</b>. Snap’s <b>Lens Studio</b> allows for <b>no-code development</b> with AI assistance.</p>

        <h6>📌 What You Need to Get Started:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>📚 Basic knowledge of <b>JavaScript</b> for advanced customizations.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>💰 Snap’s Funding & Developer Support</h4>
        <p>📢 Snap Inc. offers <b>funding opportunities</b> for developers working on <b>AR experiences</b> for Spectacles.</p>

        <h6>📌 How to Get Funding from Snap:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>💡 Develop a unique <b>AR Lens or Spectacles experience</b>.</li>
