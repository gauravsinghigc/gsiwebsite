        <h4>How to Become a ReactJS Developer Complete Beginner to Advanced Crash Course Guide by Gaurav Singh (gauravsinghigc)</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your ReactJS skills, this comprehensive crash course will guide you through all the core concepts and help you become a proficient ReactJS developer.</p>

        <h5>1. What is ReactJS?</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage their states efficiently.</p>

        <h6>Core Components of ReactJS:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JSX:</strong> JavaScript XML syntax that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Reusable, self-contained code blocks representing parts of the UI.</li>
            <li><strong>State & Props:</strong> State allows data to change dynamically, and props are used to pass data to components.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Handling events like clicks, changes, etc., within the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle Methods:</strong> Methods used for managing different stages of a component’s life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>2. Key Concepts in ReactJS</h5>

        <h6>JSX (JavaScript XML)</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML. It allows developers to write HTML elements in their JavaScript code and can make the code more readable and maintainable. React uses JSX to create components and UI elements.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Learning Topics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing JSX code and using expressions inside JSX.</li>
            <li>JSX elements vs. React.createElement()</li>
            <li>Embedding JavaScript logic in JSX.</li>
            <li>Using components with JSX syntax.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>React Components</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">React allows developers to build UI using components. Components are the building blocks of a React application and can be functional or class-based.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Learning Topics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding functional vs. class components.</li>
            <li>Creating and rendering components.</li>
            <li>Component reusability and prop drilling.</li>
            <li>Using default props and prop validation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>State and Props</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">State and props are essential concepts in ReactJS for managing data. While state represents data that can change over time, props are used to pass data between components.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Learning Topics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using useState hook for functional components.</li>
            <li>Understanding state initialization and updates.</li>
            <li>Using props to pass data to child components.</li>
            <li>Managing state between parent and child components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Event Handling in ReactJS</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">React provides a way to handle events like clicks, changes, and keyboard actions within components. This allows users to interact with the application in a seamless way.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Learning Topics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Binding event handlers in React.</li>
            <li>Handling user inputs (forms, buttons, etc.).</li>
            <li>Preventing default events and managing custom events.</li>
            <li>Handling asynchronous events with promises or async/await.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3. Installation and Setup of ReactJS</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">To get started with ReactJS, you need to install a few prerequisites and set up the development environment. Follow these steps to install and set up ReactJS:</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js installed on your machine (Check the version by running `node -v` in the terminal).</li>
            <li>npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn for managing packages (npm comes with Node.js by default).</li>
            <li>A code editor like VSCode for writing React code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Installation Steps:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Install Node.js from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js official website</a>.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Install ReactJS using Create React App:
                <pre>npx create-react-app my-app</pre>
                This command will create a new React project with the necessary configuration.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: Navigate into the project directory:
                <pre>cd my-app</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Step 4: Start the React development server:
                <pre>npm start</pre>
                Your default browser will open with the React application running on localhost.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>4. Common Errors and Troubleshooting During Installation</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">While installing and setting up ReactJS, you may encounter a few errors. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Node.js is not installed:</strong> If you receive an error indicating that Node.js is not installed, download and install Node.js from the official website and ensure that `node -v` and `npm -v` return the correct version numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Permission issues (Mac/Linux):</strong> If you face permission issues while installing packages, use `sudo` for administrative access:</li>
            <pre>sudo npm install -g create-react-app</pre>
            <li><strong>npm install errors:</strong> If you're getting errors during `npm install`, try clearing the npm cache and reinstalling the dependencies:</li>
            <pre>npm cache clean --force</pre>
            <li><strong>Dependencies version mismatch:</strong> If you face issues with mismatched dependencies, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then run:</li>
            <pre>npm install</pre>
            <li><strong>React App not opening in the browser:</strong> If the app does not open in the browser after running `npm start`, make sure your port is free or change the port by running:</li>
            <pre>PORT=3001 npm start</pre>
        </ul>

        <h5>5. Advanced ReactJS Concepts</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">Once you have mastered the basics, it's important to dive into advanced ReactJS concepts to enhance your development skills. Here are some advanced topics you should explore:</p>
