        <h4>ðŸ“‰ 'This is no 2008-style crash': Helios Capital's Samir Arora Explains Why This Bear Market Is Different</h4>

        <p>The <strong>Indian stock market</strong> is witnessing a <strong>steep decline</strong>, and investor fears are running high. However, <strong>Helios Capital founder</strong> <strong>Samir Arora</strong> believes there is <strong>no reason to compare</strong> the current downturn to past market crashes like the <strong>2000 dot-com bubble</strong> or the <strong>2008 global financial crisis (GFC)</strong>.</p>

        <p>According to Arora, the <strong>current bear market</strong> is fundamentally different as it is not driven by <strong>systemic excesses</strong> or <strong>economic distress</strong>. He dismissed <strong>parallels</strong> with previous market crashes, highlighting the absence of major economic disruptions.</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Why Is This Bear Market Different?</strong></p>
        <p>"Why this <strong>bear market</strong> is not like <strong>2000 and 2008</strong> â€” and it is so wrong to compare with them â€” is because this time it is not accompanied by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Excessive and wasteful investments</strong> in any sector.</li>
            <li><strong>Massive job losses</strong> in the corporate sector.</li>
            <li><strong>Property price crashes</strong> or housing market collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Unwinding of leveraged positions</strong> by institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Spike in Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)</strong> among banks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Arora confidently stated, <strong>"This is merely a valuation correction</strong> of a group of companies without any <strong>real economic harm</strong>. Hence, the recovery period will be much faster compared to the past market crashes."</p>

        <h5>ðŸ“Š Bear Market Insights: Arora vs Sharma</h5>
        <p>Interestingly, <strong>Arora's optimism</strong> comes just days after <strong>veteran investor Shankar Sharma</strong> expressed serious concerns about the ongoing market downturn. Sharma described the current bear market as a <strong>'100% local problem'</strong> requiring a <strong>domestic solution</strong>.</p>

        <p>During a discussion at the <strong>Moneycontrol Global Wealth Summit 2025</strong> in <strong>Mumbai</strong>, <strong>Sharma</strong> warned that <strong>India's five-year bull run</strong> is <strong>losing steam</strong> and the markets may deliver <strong>zero returns</strong> over the next <strong>four to five years</strong> from its September 2024 highs.</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸš¨ Sharma's Major Concerns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavily overheated <strong>small-cap stocks</strong> that are prone to sharp corrections.</li>
            <li>Weak policy response from the government.</li>
            <li>High <strong>foreign institutional investor (FII)</strong> outflows.</li>
            <li>Rapid fall in the <strong>Indian rupee</strong>.</li>
            <li>Increasing <strong>US bond yields</strong>, adding pressure to the stock market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>ðŸ”¥ What Did Sharma Say About Market Recovery?</h5>
        <p>Sharma drew parallels with India's historical bear markets, stating:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"We have had four major bear markets in India since 1990:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1992:</strong> Harshad Mehta Scam.</li>
                <li><strong>2000:</strong> Dot-com Bubble Crash.</li>
                <li><strong>2008:</strong> Global Financial Crisis (GFC).</li>
                <li><strong>2020:</strong> COVID-19 Market Crash.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The market recovered quickly in three of these cases except the Harshad Mehta scam because it was a local crisis. This time, it feels similar."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Sharma further criticized</strong> the government's response to the market downturn, stating:</p>
        <p><strong>"We need to find our own bullets to come out of this. And if a 0.25% rate cut or â‚¹800 per capita stimulus count as solutions, then God save us."</strong></p>

        <h5>ðŸ“Š Sharmaâ€™s Prediction: Will Nifty 50 Deliver Zero Returns?</h5>
        <p>Sharma also warned that <strong>Nifty 50</strong> may deliver <strong>zero returns</strong> over the next <strong>four to five years</strong> from its September 2024 highs. He shared his personal experience, stating:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"I tried to sell everything I could in July 2024 when the market was booming. However, I got stuck with some investments and now I'm hoping for another bull market by 2030."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h5>ðŸ’¸ How Much Market Value Has India Lost?</h5>
        <p>According to the latest market data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>BSE Sensex's total market capitalization</strong> has declined by <strong>â‚¹25 lakh crore</strong> since <strong>September 26, 2024</strong>.</li>
            <li>The <strong>valuation of all BSE-listed firms</strong> has dropped by a whopping <strong>â‚¹92 lakh crore</strong>.</li>
            <li>Increased <strong>FII selling</strong> and a rapid fall in the <strong>rupee</strong> have amplified the losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>ðŸ’¼ What Lies Ahead For The Indian Stock Market?</h5>
        <p>While <strong>Samir Arora</strong> remains confident about a faster recovery due to the absence of systemic issues, <strong>Shankar Sharma</strong> believes that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small-cap stocks</strong> are still highly overvalued.</li>
            <li>The government needs a stronger <strong>domestic financial strategy</strong> to pull out of the bear market.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Indian stock market</strong> may not show significant growth until 2030.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Final Thought:</strong> Will <strong>Samir Arora's optimism</strong> prevail or will <strong>Shankar Sharma's cautious prediction</strong> turn true?</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ“Š Keep tracking the Indian stock market</strong> as it navigates through this bear market phase.</p>
