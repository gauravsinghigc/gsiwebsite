        <h4>🏏 <b>RCB Dominate Delhi Capitals with Convincing 8-Wicket Victory in WPL 2025</b></h4>

        <p>The <b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)</b> continued their perfect start to the <b>Women’s Premier League (WPL) 2025</b> with a dominant <b>8-wicket win</b> over <b>Delhi Capitals (DC)</b>. Led by <b>Smriti Mandhana’s blistering 81</b>, RCB chased down the target of 142 in just <b>16.2 overs</b>, making it two wins in two games. Earlier, <b>Renuka Singh Thakur</b> and <b>Georgia Wareham</b> starred with the ball, picking up three wickets each to dismantle DC’s batting lineup.</p>

        <h5>🔍 <b>DC Collapse Under RCB’s Bowling Attack</b></h5>
        <p>Put in to bat due to anticipated <b>dew</b> in the second innings, <b>Delhi Capitals</b> suffered an early setback as <b>Shafali Verma</b> was dismissed on the very first ball. <b>Jemimah Rodrigues (34)</b> and <b>Meg Lanning</b> attempted to rebuild, smashing boundaries against <b>Renuka Singh Thakur</b> and <b>Kim Garth</b>. However, <b>Georgia Wareham</b> broke the partnership, dismissing Rodrigues via a sharp stumping. Lanning soon followed as <b>RCB applied pressure</b> with disciplined bowling.</p>

        <p>🛑 After a promising start, DC crumbled from <b>60/1 to 105/6</b>, with <b>Annabel Sutherland</b>, <b>Jess Jonassen</b>, and <b>Marizanne Kapp</b> failing to make an impact. <b>Sarah Bryce (23 off 19)</b> attempted to push the total past 150 but was stumped by Wareham. Thakur and Garth wrapped up the tail, restricting <b>Delhi Capitals to 141 in 19.3 overs</b>.</p>

        <h5>🔥 <b>Smriti Mandhana’s Masterclass Seals RCB’s Victory</b></h5>
        <p>RCB’s chase got off to an electrifying start with <b>Smriti Mandhana</b> taking full advantage of Kapp’s errant line. Partnering with <b>Danielle Wyatt-Hodge (42)</b>, she took on the bowlers aggressively, smashing boundaries off <b>Shikkha Pandey</b> and <b>Arundhati Reddy</b>. By the end of the PowerPlay, RCB had already <b>raced to 57/0</b>.</p>

        <p>Mandhana continued her onslaught, reaching her <b>fastest WPL half-century</b> off just <b>27 balls</b>. She and Wyatt-Hodge put together a commanding <b>107-run opening partnership</b>. Even though Wyatt-Hodge was dismissed after being dropped earlier, <b>RCB remained in total control</b>.</p>

        <p>A <b>fielding mishap</b> between <b>Lanning and Sutherland</b> further summed up DC’s struggles as they let an easy chance slip. Mandhana brought the chase within touching distance with a <b>blazing six and boundary</b>, before falling at <b>fine-leg</b>. <b>Richa Ghosh</b> finished off the game in style with a <b>four and a six</b>, sealing the victory with 22 balls to spare.</p>
