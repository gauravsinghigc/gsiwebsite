        <h4>🏍️ Aprilia Tuono 457 First Ride Review – Italian Close to Perfection</h4>
        <p>Ever since the <b>Aprilia RS457</b> hit the Indian market, enthusiasts have eagerly awaited its naked sibling—the <b>Tuono 457</b>. Now, it's finally here. First showcased at <b>EICMA</b>, the Tuono 457 received mixed reactions due to its design and dimensions compared to the RS457. However, after riding it, we can say we’re impressed—though with a few reservations. Here’s our <b>first ride review</b> of the <b>Aprilia Tuono 457</b>.</p>

        <h5>🎨 Aprilia Tuono 457 First Impressions and Design</h5>
        <p>For aspirational motorcycles like the Tuono 457, design plays a crucial role in attracting buyers. Fortunately, this motorcycle does not disappoint.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>💠 The Tuono 457 has a balanced size—not too large or small.</li>
            <li>🛞 The <b>tank shrouds</b> and <b>exposed frame</b> enhance its aggressive look.</li>
            <li>💨 The <b>rear tail section</b> is identical to the RS457—sleek and narrow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unlike the traditional <b>Tuono design</b> featuring a half-fairing with split headlights, the new Tuono 457 adopts a fresh approach. The front-end styling is subjective—some might appreciate its modern aesthetics, while others may prefer the older half-fairing look. The <b>split DRLs</b> remain, but the headlight is now stacked vertically. While this might take some time to get used to, it adds a distinctive character to the Tuono 457.</p>

        <h5>🏎️ Ride, Performance, and Handling</h5>
        <p>This is where the <b>Aprilia Tuono 457</b> truly shines, carving out a unique identity for itself.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🤏 The bike feels <b>compact</b> between the legs, making it an ideal fit for riders around <b>5'7"</b> and above.</li>
            <li>🛑 The new <b>handlebar</b> enhances the upright riding posture, offering a balance of comfort and control.</li>
            <li>🎶 The <b>exhaust note</b> is deep and aggressive, making it a head-turner.</li>
            <li>⚙️ Aprilia has used a <b>rear sprocket with one extra tooth</b>, improving low-end grunt and responsiveness.</li>
            <li>💨 The <b>47bhp engine</b> delivers power smoothly but remains sporty throughout the rev range.</li>
            <li>🏁 The bike leans effortlessly into corners, showcasing its <b>sharp handling</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In terms of <b>suspension</b>, Aprilia has retained the setup from the RS457. It remains on the stiffer side but isn’t overly harsh. It absorbs road imperfections well, but deep potholes—common on Indian roads—can unsettle the front-end slightly.</p>

        <h5>🖥️ Electronics – Feature-Packed but Functional</h5>
        <p>To complement its performance, the <b>Tuono 457</b> comes equipped with advanced electronics.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>⚡ <b>4 Levels of Traction Control</b> – Including an option to turn it off completely.</li>
            <li>🚀 <b>3 Ride Modes</b> – Eco (smoothest power delivery), Sport (more aggressive response), and another intermediate setting.</li>
            <li>📱 <b>5-inch TFT Display</b> – Offers <b>phone connectivity, notifications, and navigation</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While riding through <b>the twisty roads of Nandi Hills</b> on a bright day, traction control intervention was minimal, allowing the Tuono 457 to show off its natural agility.</p>

        <h5>🛠️ Brakes and Ergonomics – Room for Improvement</h5>
        <p>One of the first things we wanted to test was the braking system. While there’s an improvement over previous models, there’s still room for enhancement.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🔧 The new <b>sintered brake pads</b> offer better stopping power than the previous organic pads.</li>
            <li>❌ <b>Non-adjustable brake and clutch levers</b> – This could be an issue for some riders.</li>
            <li>⚠️ <b>Adjustable levers</b> are only available as accessories, which feels unfair at a <b>₹3.95 lakh price tag</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>💰 Should You Buy the Aprilia Tuono 457?</h5>
        <p>With all aspects considered, should you go for the <b>Aprilia Tuono 457</b>?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🚀 The Tuono 457 is <b>fast, handles beautifully, and is engaging to ride</b>.</li>
            <li>🏍️ However, it is nearly <b>₹1 lakh more expensive</b> than the <b>KTM 390 Duke</b>.</li>
            <li>🔝 The <b>390 Duke</b> offers similar performance, fantastic handling, and extra features like <b>standard adjustable levers and a bidirectional quickshifter</b>.</li>
            <li>🇮🇹 That said, <b>Italian motorcycles</b> have always carried a premium price tag.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For those willing to <b>pay extra for an exotic, fast, and stylish street naked</b>, the Tuono 457 is a great option. However, we strongly recommend taking a <b>test ride</b>—which starts in <b>March</b>—before making a final decision. One thing is certain: the <b>Tuono 457 is a fun machine</b>.</p>
