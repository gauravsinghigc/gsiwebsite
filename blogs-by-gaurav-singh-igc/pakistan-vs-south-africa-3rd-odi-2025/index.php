        <h4>💬 Post-Match Reactions</h4>

        <h5>📢 Mohammad Rizwan:</h5>
        <p>"Thanks to the Almighty for helping us with this record chase. We thought we could restrict them to 300, but <strong>Klaasen’s innings</strong> took them to 350. However, we have chased such totals before, and that gave us confidence. Our <strong>fielding must improve</strong> before the <strong>Champions Trophy</strong>."</p>

        <h5>📢 Temba Bavuma:</h5>
        <p>"We were confident with <strong>350 runs on the board</strong>, but our bowlers couldn’t sustain pressure. The <strong>middle overs are crucial</strong>, and we need to find ways to stop opposition batters from scoring freely. If these are the <strong>wickets for the Champions Trophy</strong>, it will be a challenge for bowlers."</p>

        <h5>📢 Salman Agha (Player of the Match):</h5>
        <p>"It was a great <strong>wicket to bat on</strong>. Our plan was to take the <strong>game deep</strong> and control the chase <strong>five overs at a time</strong>. The start was crucial, and we built momentum as the innings progressed."</p>

        <hr>

        <h5>🚀 Key Moments:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Rizwan & Agha’s 260-run stand:</strong> Pakistan’s highest 4th-wicket partnership in ODIs.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Rizwan’s finishing touch:</strong> Unbeaten 122 off 128 balls.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Agha’s aggressive knock:</strong> 134 off 103 balls, hitting 16 boundaries and 2 sixes.</li>
