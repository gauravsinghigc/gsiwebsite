        <h4>🎯 Rohit Sharma’s 'Use Your Brain' Gesture After Arshdeep Singh Outfoxes England Star</h4>
        <p><strong>Ahmedabad:</strong> India captain <strong>Rohit Sharma</strong> expressed his delight after pacer <strong>Arshdeep Singh</strong> perfectly executed his bowling plan in the <strong>third and final ODI against England</strong> at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday. The defining moment came in the <strong>seventh over</strong> when Arshdeep dismissed <strong>Ben Duckett</strong>, handing India a crucial breakthrough.</p>

        <h5>🔥 Arshdeep’s Revenge on Duckett</h5>
        <p>Duckett had earlier smashed Arshdeep for <strong>four consecutive boundaries</strong> in the previous over, putting pressure on the young pacer. However, Arshdeep made a strong comeback, trapping Duckett with a cleverly disguised <strong>knuckle ball</strong>. Due to a groin issue, Duckett mistimed his pull shot, allowing Rohit to take an easy catch at mid-off.</p>

        <h6>🧠 Rohit’s 'Brain-Tap' Celebration</h6>
        <p>After completing the catch, Rohit Sharma was seen making a <strong>'brain-tap' gesture</strong>, indicating that Arshdeep’s smart strategy had worked. This moment quickly went viral among cricket fans.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>“Rohit's brilliance! Duckett gone! #INDvsENG”</strong></p>

        </blockquote>

        <h5>💥 Double Blow by Arshdeep</h5>
        <p>Arshdeep continued his impressive spell by dismissing England opener <strong>Phil Salt</strong>, who was caught at short third man by <strong>Axar Patel</strong>. His <strong>double strike in the powerplay</strong> put India in control early on.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Double-strike for Arshdeep Singh! Successful powerplay for #TeamIndia”</p>
