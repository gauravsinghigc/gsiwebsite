        <h4>Samsung expanding OneUI 7 update to more phones: Is yours on the list?</h4>

        <p>Samsung's <strong>OneUI 7 update</strong> is making headlines as the company expands its rollout beyond the <strong>Galaxy S25 series</strong>. Initially available for the <strong>Galaxy S24 lineup</strong>, the update is now being prepared for more <strong>flagship and mid-range devices</strong>. Samsung has been internally testing <strong>OneUI 7</strong> on several models, with recent firmware builds hinting at an upcoming beta release.</p>

        <h5>Which phones are getting OneUI 7 next?</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Galaxy Z Flip 6</strong> and <strong>Galaxy Z Fold 6</strong> have been spotted with new firmware ending in "ZYBG," indicating internal testing for <strong>OneUI 7 beta</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Galaxy S23 series</strong> is also expected to receive the update soon, as Samsung shifts focus to older flagship models.</li>
            <li><strong>Galaxy A55</strong> has surfaced with a new software build (A556EXXU6ZYB6), signaling active beta testing.</li>
            <li>Samsung has created a <strong>OneUI 7 Beta Forum</strong> for the Galaxy A55, which typically happens before a public beta release.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Rollout inconsistencies and newly launched devices</h5>

        <p>While Samsung is expanding the <strong>OneUI 7 update</strong>, the rollout remains inconsistent. The newly launched <strong>Galaxy A36</strong> and <strong>Galaxy A56</strong>, along with budget models like the <strong>Galaxy F06</strong> and <strong>Galaxy M06</strong>, already ship with <strong>OneUI 7 pre-installed</strong>. However, some older flagship models, including the <strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra</strong>, are still running beta versions.</p>

        <h5>When will your phone get OneUI 7?</h5>

        <p>Samsung has not provided an official release date for the stable version of <strong>OneUI 7</strong> across all devices. However, rumors suggest that the final update for the <strong>Galaxy S24 series</strong> could arrive by <strong>April 2025</strong>. If true, other eligible devices might receive the update in the following months.</p>

        <p>For now, if you own a <strong>recent flagship Galaxy device</strong> or a popular <strong>mid-range model</strong>, you may receive <strong>OneUI 7 soon</strong>. Stay updated with <strong>Samsung's official announcements</strong> and software updates to check if your phone is included in the rollout.</p>
